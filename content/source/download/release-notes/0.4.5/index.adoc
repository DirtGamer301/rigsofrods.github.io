== Development cycle
Release 0.4.5 "NextStable" has had the longest development streak in Rigs of Rods history: more than 2 years. As it happened, the old team left and the project was left dormant until the new group led by Petr Ohlidal (@only-a-ptr) formed. This is the first release by the new team.
