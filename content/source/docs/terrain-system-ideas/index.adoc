== Useful terrain resources

Here's a short list of articles that I've found useful while thinking about this terrain engine.<br> 

* http://www.terrain.dk/[Very Large, Very Detailed Terrain] - procedural fractal detail generation (but missing any type of alpha splatting or vector overlays for user-specified detail like roads or parking lots) 
* http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/1324/http:zSzzSzwww9.informatik.uni-erlangen.dezSzPersonszSzKobbeltzSzpaperszSzfour.pdf/kobbelt96interpolatory.pdf[Four-Point Subdivision] - The subdivision method used to divide the heightmap smoothly before applying fractal detail (note that this requires the two neighboring points to each page. This will be handled by asking the neighbor for the height values, and using linear interpolation if it is not yet loaded (it will be beyond the view distance anyway).
* http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/proj/geomclipmap/[Geometry Clipmaps] - their compression method looks to be best-in-class, though their GPU representation seems a little weird - it doesn't account for portions of land that are detailed enough to be displayed at a higher LODs farther away, and large enough flat places nearby to be displayed at lower LODs. In other words it assumes all terrains are *perfect* fractals.
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Graphics_File[Progressive Graphics File] - an image compression library which works especially well on natural images (of which heightmaps are model citizens).
* http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/proj/geomclipmap/[Vector-based terrains] - this one talks about using a spline graph to create user specified detail at resolutions higher than that stored in the heightmap. This is perfect for roads, but their textures are cartoony-looking for a reason... the textures they generate still have pixels bigger than one inch even directly below you. If I use this approach, I'll have to subdivide further down to get a decent level of detail, and I'm not sure that there will be enough memory. (edit) If I generate the textures procedurally every frame in the pixel shader, it may work, but it may also kill the gpu. I may instead implement the flattening in the vertex shader, then use decals to actually draw the roads on top of the terrain.
* http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/1425/pdf/imm1425.pdf[Real-time Terrain Rendering using Smooth Hardware Optimized Level of Detail] describes the LOD approach used by Ogre's terrain engine (except Ogre uses skirts instead of stitching), which will be incorporated into mine. They don't care much about texturing or anything other than the underlying mesh.
* http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter26.html[GPU Perlin Noise] - Some variant of a 2D version of this will be used to supply the randomness to the fractal functions (instead of the blocky texture lookup used in terrain.dk).
* http://developer.amd.com/Assets/Tatarchuk-Noise%28GDC07-D3D_Day%29.pdf[More GPU Noise] - I'm still thinking about the noise generator... it has to be on the GPU and it has to be fast. This slideshow is a good overview of the concepts involved in this type of noise function.
* http://www.vterrain.org/[vTerrain.org] - a good knowledge of terrain rendering requires reading this entire site (I haven't done it yet, but I've read almost everything in the Rendering section that looked like it applied to modern GPUs). Parts and pieces of any of these papers may slip into my terrain engine.
