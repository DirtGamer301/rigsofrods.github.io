This article documents the terrain system used in Rigs of Rods.

The terrain system described here was introduced in version 0.4 and provides many new features and improved performance.

The previous terrain system was based upon Ogre engine's TerrainManager component, which was obsoleted, and thus RoR couldn't support it anymore.

New terrain features::
* Alpha splatting supported by the engine itself, no need to provide your own shader
* Improved speed: better LOD system
* Global Light maps: Mountains will shadow the terrain if the sun is low, etc.
* Caching of terrain Data: the Terrain is generated on the first start and then written to cache (disk). The second start is then much faster.
* Integrated normal mapping
* Integrated parallax mapping
* Composite blend replacement: if you go away far enough, the alpha splats will be replaced by some rendered texture to improve speed.
* Paging support: ability to load multiple pages of the terrain. (all at once only right now)
* Editable in theory, in practice not implemented yet.

File type overview::
* `.terrn2`: Entry point for the terrain.Every terrain has one .terrn2
* `.otc`: Configures the Ogre terrain, replaces the old .cfg format.
* `.os` - Caelum system (sky/weather) config
* `.hdx` - Hydrax config (0.4.5 and up)
* `.png/./jpg/.dds` - Terrain textures and heightmap

== Ogre Terrain Page Config (.otc)

The terrain consists of pages. Number of pages is defined by PagesX and PagesZ (described above). There must be at least 1 page.

For each page, there must be an .otc file. File name format is set by PageFileFormat (described above). If there's just one page, it'll be named like "MapName-page-0-0.otc"

The page-config file specifies a heightmap to use for the page and terrain texture layers.

=== Format overview

* *Line1:* Heightmap (file name). For example: my_heightmap.png
* *Line2:* Number of layers (integral number in range 1-6) The OgreTerrain component has a limit of 6 layers (5 blendmaps)
* *Line3 and further:* Layer definitions (see below)

=== Layer definitions

* Lines starting with semicolon * ' ; ' * are comments
* Layer definition line has these values, separated by * ' , ' * comma :
** *size* (real number 1-2048) The target size of the texture on the terrain
** *diffusespecular* (file name) The filename of the texture with the following format: RGB=Diffuse Color, A=Specular map
** *normalheight* (file name) The filename of the texture with the following format: RGB=Normal map, A=Heightmap for parallax mapping
** *blendmap* (file name) Blendmap texture file name
** *blendmapmode* (One capital letter: R / G / B / A) Which color channel of the blendmap use for blending this layer.
** *opacity* (Real number 0-1) Setting to 0 makes layer invisible.

Layer at position #0 is a ground layer - it covers the entire page and thus needs no *blendmap*. It only accepts first 3 arguments: [size] [diffusespecular] [normalheight]

Layers #1 - #5 only cover areas which have a corresponding color in the *blendmap*.

== Terrain Objects (.tobj)
(you define your objects here)

Sample Syntax

[source,java]
----
X,Z,Y,ROTX,ROTZ,ROTY, ObjectName
----

{{sandbox|More lines for more objects, just like you did in the old terrn file}}

""".Odef files are the same"""

NOTE: this page will get updated with terrain system development.

== Example Simple Terrain
Some examples of how the 0.4 terrain system is used:

* [[:Media:Simple2.zip|Simple2.zip]]

(add your own)

== Old Terrain System (pre 0.4)
The old terrain system was very limited in sense of features and is obsolete since RoR version 0.4.0.

=== Overview

File type overview::
* `.terrn` - You define terrain name, associated .cfg name, spawn point position, ambient colour and various object positions.
* `.cfg` - You define Terrain Texture, RAW Heightmap file, World Sizes and Height, Tiles the map get divided into, Terrain LOD and additional stuff.
* `.RAW` - A greyscale image which is the heightmap of the terrain.
* `.os` - Caelum Config
* `.png/./jpg/.dds` - terrain Texture.

=== Upgrading to current terrain system
Currently, the only way to convert to the 0.4 terrain system is by hand as the layer textures need to be remapped due to the added features.

Just try to follow these steps (example with smallisland below):

Preparational work::
* create a folder in `Rigs of Rods 0.4\terrains\` (i.e. `smallisland`)
* unpack the files from the old terrain zip there

=== Terrn2
* create an empty text file named `<>.terrn2` (`smallisland.terrn2`) with the following template:

[source, ini]
----
[General]
Name = 
GeometryConfig = 
Water=0
AmbientColor = 1, 1, 1
StartPosition =
CategoryID = 129
Version = 2
GUID = 

[Authors]
terrain = 

[Objects]
----

Now fill that with the following info:

[General] section::
* `Name` - the terrain name that should be shown in the loader/chooser
* `GeometryConfig` - the terrain name + .otc (i.e. smallisland.otc)
* `Water` - if "w" is provided in the old terrain file, add
** `Water=1`
** `WaterLine=72` (the 'w' value)
** `WaterBottomLine=42` ( the 'w' value -30)
* `StartPosition` : the start position (X Y Z) without commas! take the first three values from the 5th or so line from the old config (REMOVE the commas!) (i.e. first three of: "147.346, 87.3784, 545.694, 147.346, 87.3784, 545.694, 147.346, 87.3784, 545.694")
* `GUID` - go to http://www.guidgenerator.com/ and generate one
[Authors] section::
* `terrain` - name the old author

Afterwards your `.terr2` should look like this:

[source, ini]
----
[General]
Name = Small Island
GeometryConfig = smallisland.otc
Water=1
WaterLine=72
WaterBottomLine=42
AmbientColor = 1, 1, 1
StartPosition = 147.346 87.3784 545.694
CategoryID = 129
Version = 2
GUID = bfd9e795-9f90-4b46-9a3b-4b48408d58ad

[Authors]
terrain = Pittras
update = tdev

[Objects]
----

=== OTC
Next: create a text file named "smallisland.otc" (the name you provided under `GeometryConfig`) with the following template:

[source, ini]
----
WorldSizeX=
WorldSizeZ=
WorldSizeY=

PageSize=
PageFileFormat=

Heightmap.0.0.raw.size=
Heightmap.0.0.raw.bpp=
Heightmap.0.0.flipX=

disableCaching=1
LightmapEnabled=0
NormalMappingEnabled=0
SpecularMappingEnabled=1
ParallaxMappingEnabled=0
GlobalColourMapEnabled=0
ReceiveDynamicShadowsDepth=0
----

Fill that out too:

* `WorldSizeX` - size of the world in X direction, find that value in the old .cfg file as `PageWorldX`
* `WorldSizeZ` - size of the world in Z direction, find that value in the old .cfg file as `PageWorldZ`
* `WorldSizeY` - multiplier of the heightmap in Y direction, find that value in the old .cfg file as `MaxHeight`
* `PageSize` - size of the heightmap, must be 2^n+1, take `PageSize` from the old .cfg, i.e. 1025
* `PageFileFormat` - formatting of the page filename. Format: _yourmap-page-0-0.otc_

If your terrain heightmap is in raw format provide the following settings:

* Set `Heightmap.0.0.raw.size` to the value of `Heightmap.raw.size`, i.e. `Heightmap.raw.size=1025`
* Set `Heightmap.0.0.raw.bpp` to the value of `Heightmap.raw.bpp`, i.e. `Heightmap.raw.bpp=2`
* If `Heightmap` is filled in the old terrain (`Heightmap.flip=true`), then add `Heightmap.0.0.flipX=1` to the .otc

Our example looks like this now:

[source, ini]
----
WorldSizeX=1000
WorldSizeZ=1000
WorldSizeY=300

PageSize=1025
PageFileFormat=smallisland-page-0-0.otc

Heightmap.0.0.raw.size=1025
Heightmap.0.0.raw.bpp=2
Heightmap.0.0.flipX=1

disableCaching=1
LightmapEnabled=0
NormalMappingEnabled=0
SpecularMappingEnabled=1
ParallaxMappingEnabled=0
GlobalColourMapEnabled=0
ReceiveDynamicShadowsDepth=0
----

Next: create a text file named _smallisland-page-0-0.otc_ (you already provided the filename format in the main smallisland.otc") with the following template:

[source, ini]
----
<heightmap filename="">
< number of layers>
; worldSize, diffusespecular, normalheight, blendmap, blendmapmode, alpha
< size, diffusespecular, normalheight>
</heightmap>
----

To avoid a shiny terrain, follow [http://www.rigsofrods.com/threads/109873-0-37-Content-Pack-Maps-0-4-0-7?p=1269382&viewfull=1#post1269382 this tutorial].
The shininess is controlled by the alpha channel of your diffuse texture. A white (or missing) alpha channel means shiny, a black one matte. 

NOTE: Your alpha channel needs to be a bit brighter than completely black (RGB value of [1, 1, 1] instead of [0, 0, 0]), otherwise the alpha channel will not be saved.

Our example looks like this now:

[source, ini]
----
smallisland.raw
1
; worldSize, diffusespecular, normalheight, blendmap, blendmapmode, alpha
1000  , smallisland.dds, smallisland.dds
----

=== Terrain Objects
Create an entry under the `[Objects]` section in the terrn2-file for a filename followed by an equal sign, i.e.:

[source, ini]
----
[Objects]
smallisland.tobj=
----

Then create a text file named like that (i.e. _smallisland.tobj_) and copy and paste all remaining lines from the old .terrn into that file. Leave out the "end".
It is also possible to split the objects into multiple files.

* You are done with the basics :)
* You can download the upgrade example http://www.rigsofrods.com/wiki/images/7/78/Smallisland.zip[here]

The example looks like this at this point:

image::smallisland.webp[role=""]

== Troubleshooting ==
* Q: Why is everything so shiny?
** A: You might need to enable Specular Mapping (SpecularMappingEnabled=1) and darken the Alpha channel of your diffuse texture (it needs to be very dark to remove the shininess). http://www.rigsofrods.com/threads/109873-0-37-Content-Pack-Maps-0-4-0-7?p=1269382&viewfull=1#post1269382[Click here for a tutorial].
* Q: Why are procedural roads not working anymore?
** A: They are removed to be replaced by a better system in the near future.
* Q: How to convert .RAW images?
** A: See <<{baseurl}/creating-a-raw-file/index.adoc#Automated_Image_to_raw_file_Bat_scripts,here>>
