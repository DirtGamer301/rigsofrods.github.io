"So, for soft suspension you would want low spring and relatively low damp, and the opposite for stiff suspension (high spring and relatively high damp). Shocks behave differently based on the force acted upon them. So a shock that is good for a truck weighing several tonnes will be much too 'stiff' for the same shock on a street car.
