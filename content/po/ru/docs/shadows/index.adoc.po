"Rigs of Rods uses the Parallel-Split Shadow Maps technique. Shadow textures "
"are split into 3 parts with different resolutions and size. The closest one "
"to the camera is the smallest and has the greatest resolution. The second "
"and the third are sometimes equal in resolution but not in size. Shadow "
"details progressively degrade as soon as you get into the 2nd and 3rd split."
