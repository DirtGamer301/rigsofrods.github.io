"The tracks are simple meshes that are placed on the map. They have a "
"collision mesh on which all rail vehicles drive. The track gauge is "
"approximately 1435mm, which is the most common in the world. In reality "
"train wheels have flanges. In RoR wheels can’t have such a geometry, so we "
"use nodes with low friction to keep everything on the rail (we call them "
"guidance nodes). Propulsed rail vehicles use standard wheels spanning the "
"two rails. The result is a quite long wheel what may be odd on the first "
"sight, but if you think about it real train wheels are basically the same. "
"This also helps to keep the nodecount down. See Figure 1."

"The wagons use low friction nodes instead of wheels. Main reason is the "
