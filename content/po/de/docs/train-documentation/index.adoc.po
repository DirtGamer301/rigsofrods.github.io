"The tracks are simple meshes that are placed on the map. They have a "
"collision mesh on which all rail vehicles drive. The track gauge is "
"approximately 1435mm, which is the most common in the world. In reality "
"train wheels have flanges. In RoR wheels can’t have such a geometry, so we "
"use nodes with low friction to keep everything on the rail (we call them "
"guidance nodes). Propulsed rail vehicles use standard wheels spanning the "
"two rails. The result is a quite long wheel what may be odd on the first "
"sight, but if you think about it real train wheels are basically the same. "
"This also helps to keep the nodecount down. See Figure 1."

"Die Spuren sind einfache meshes die auf der Map platziert worden sind. Sie "
"haben eine Kollisions-mesh auf der alle Züge fahren. Die Spurweite ist 1435 "
"mm, welche am meisten auf der Welt verwendet wird. Reale Züge haben "
"Flanschen, aber in RoR können diese Räder nicht solche Flanschen haben, "
"deshalb benutzen wir nodes mit geringer Reibung um alles auf der Schiene zu "
"behalten (wir nennen das guidance-nodes (deutsch : Führungs-nodes)). "
"Schienenfahrzeuge benutzen die normale Antriebs-Spannung zwischen den "
"Schienen. Das Resultat ist ein ziemlich langes Rad, das vielleicht seltsam "
"erscheint, aber wenn du an echte Züge denkst, ist das Prinzip das Gleiche. "
"Dies hilft auch, die nod-Anzahl niedrig zu halten. (Bild 1)"

"The wagons use low friction nodes instead of wheels. Main reason is the "

"Die Wagons benutzen (wie die Züge in RoR) nodes mit geringer Reibung. "
