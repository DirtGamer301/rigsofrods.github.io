This page documents Truck Description File, the vehicle description format of Rigs of Rods game engine.

== Introduction

This file is in text format. It contains all the structural, physical and visual parameters defining a truck. It is parsed by a very crude parser, so stick to the syntax, or expect crashes. Some keywords seem illogical because I did not know where I was going when I started this project. So be warned that this stuff is not foolproof. It is decomposed in sections, each section is announced by a keyword (except the title).

Comment lines can be inserted by putting ";" or "//" at the beginning of the line.

== Building Philosophy

See <<{baseurl}/truck-concepts/index.adoc#,Truck Concepts>> to understand the building philosophy. I recommend using the following method for construction:

* Draw the blueprint of your truck on a piece drawing paper; mark the nodes, and write their number (starting with zero).
* Edit your truck file; put the title, globals, engine, cameras, nodes, and beams sections in.
* Run the game to see how it goes. If you forget some beams the truck will fold on itself!
* When the chassis seems to work well; add wheels, suspension, hydros, etc; And then test drive.
* When the truck is all working; do the bodywork and texture, and mark most beams as invisible (displaying too many beams has a large performance impact)

To see a simple truck file example, see the <<{baseurl}/rorbook/index.adoc#,RoRBook>>.

== Is It a Truck, Plane, Train or Boat?

Before we start, let's ask an important question: *Is it a truck, plane, train, or boat?* Or what makes a truck a truck and a plane a plane and a train a train, or a boat a boat? Simple:

* A truck is a description file containing an `engine` section
* A plane is a description file containing a `turboprops`, `turbojets`, or `pistonprops` section
* A boat is a description file containing a `screwprops` section
* A train is a vehicle that drives on a rail (see <<{baseurl}/train-documentation/index.adoc#,Train Documentation>>)

Also, notice that:

* You should not combine more than one propulsion (e.g. have both an `engine` and a `turboprops` section in the same file)
* If you have no propulsion, then you are making a load, and the file extension should be .load (see <<{baseurl}/creating-a-load/index.adoc#,Creating a Load>>)
* It is possible to have a `wings` section on a truck or a boat (e.g. to add aerodynamic spoilers for stability).
* You should have a `fusedrag` section on a plane to have a better aerodynamic modeling.
* A boat needs to have a hull which is defined in the `submesh` section.

== Light Cars

Here a few recommendations for those who want to build a *light car*: RoR is optimized for heavy trucks, so you have to use some extra sections that help you create a realistic car:

* Use `engoptions` to reduce the engine inertia and set the engine type to `c`
* Use `brakes` to reduce braking force
* Use and abuse `set_beam_defaults` to soften the car body, or it will be too strong and springy, i.e. almost indestructible.
* Experiment with the `engine` section to use higher RPM and correct gear ratios.
* Lighten the `wheels` as much as possible. This is not very easy as they become unstable. Reducing the spring and damping of the wheels helps a lot. Suggested values for 100kg wheels: spring 150000 and damping 1000.
* Use the `dashboard-small.mesh prop` as a dashboard. (unless you have a custom dashboard you want to use.)

== Documentation style guide

I'm currently http://rigsofrods.com/threads/108818-Patch-WIP-truck-file-parser-with-validation[rewriting the parser] and updating this document as I study the old parser. To make this document better, I decided to create a "style guide" to make it consistent and easy to read.

Every keyword (directive, inline-section or section) which has parameters should have them listed in this manner:

* *Required parameter*: [red]#Data type#; [lime]#default = VALUE#; Explanatory text.
* *Example required parameter*: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = -1.0#; Parameters are written as shown, followed by a colon. The data type should be easy to understand for a human, not technically accurate.
* *Another required parameter*: [red]#Positive decimal#;  The "default" text can be omitted if the parameter has no default. The "data type" field should always be followed by semicolon.
* *Optional parameter* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Data type#; [lime]#default = VALUE#; Optional parameters have "(optional)" text after them.
* *Required nullable parameter* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Data type#; [aqua]#Empty value = -1#; Parameters which must be entered but can contain "empty value" are described (nullable) and have "Empty value" section.
* *New parameter* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4+ ]# [red]#Data type#; Parameters with version requirements have a [ Version ] box.
* *Options* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#String#, [lime]#default = none# Options are enumerated as sub-list.
** *a*: What this option does.
** *b*: Another option
** *c* or *C*:  Case insensitive option.

Practical examples of this style: <<Set inertia defaults>>, <<Shocks>>, <<Shocks2>>, <<Slide Nodes>>

== Truck File Syntax

We go through the sections. *Order is important*: If a section depends on another (for example: cinecams requires beams), the dependent must be placed AFTER the section it depends on (cinecam AFTER beams).

=== Required Sections

The game will not run without these sections. Every one of these sections must be present for a vehicle to work in the game!

==== Title

This is the only section not introduced by a keyword. It is the name of the truck, and it absolutely positively must be the first line of the file.
`My nice truck`

==== Globals

This section defines some global parameters.

Parameters::

* *Dry mass*: [red]#Real number#; The weight RoR will try to give the truck (affected by minimum node weight, see below). Weight is measured in kilograms.
* *Load mass*: [red]#Real number#; Total mass of all nodes marked with the option "l".
* *Material name*: [red]#String#; The name of the material that will be used to texture the truck's submesh. This material must be defined in a separate material file.

[source, html]
----
globals
;dry mass, cargo mass, material
 10000.0,  1000.0,     tracks/semi
----

==== Nodes

This section begins the structural definition of the vehicle. Each line defines a node.

Parameters::

* *Node number*: [red]#Positive decimal number#; The first parameter is the node number. These numbers must be consecutive.

IMPORTANT: Do [underline]##NOT## use node 0 for any moving stuff like propellers, commands etc. It is the reference for some calculations in RoR and should be part of the rigid frame of your truck.

* *X position (in meters)*: [red]#Real number#; Node's X coordinate.
* *Y position (in meters)*: [red]#Real number#; Node's Y coordinate.
* *Z position (in meters)*: [red]#Real number#; Node's Z coordinate.
* *Options* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#String#; [lime]#default = none#; Node options. You can combine multiple flags.
** `n`: This node can be grabbed with the mouse. (Standard node)
** `m`: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.39.07+ ]#: This node can't be grabbed with the mouse. (Useful for switching levers with the mouse.)
** `f`: This node will not produce sparks. (Useful for support feet or hand made wheels.)
** `x`: This node is the exhaust point. (requires a `y` node) (see the <<Exhausts>> section)
** `y`: The exhaust reference point. This node should be placed opposite of the direction that you want the exhaust to come from.
** `c`: This node will not detect contact with ground. (Can be used for optimization on inner chassis parts, for instance.)
** `h`: This node is a hook point. (Like the hook on a crane, or a winch, or whatever.) RoR will create a beam between this Node and Node#0. If this is Node#0, it will link it to Node#1 (even if it isn't defined yet).
** `e`: This node is a terrain editing point (Like in the terrain editor truck.)
** `b`: This node is assigned an extra buoyancy force (Experimental!)
** `p`: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.3+ ]#: Disables particle effects for this node (Like dust.)
** `L`: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.3+ ]#: Enables node settings logging into the ror.log for this node
** `l`: This node bears a part of the cargo load
* *Load mass (in Kilograms)* [silver]#(optional, needs `l` flag)#: [red]#Real number#; Overrides the load mass for this node. Only valid if used with `l` option.

NOTE: The load-nodes where you specify the mass explicitly are not calculated with the global load mass. So if you specify a custom mass on any load, you will also increase the mass on all other nodes if you do not decrease the global mass.

NOTE: You can put a comment at the end of a node-line.

You can set any option property, loadweight, friction-, volume- and surface-coefficients as default with <<Set_node_defaults>>.

==== Nodes2
Nodes2 use the same syntax as nodes, except the first argument can be any string instead of a number. After using a name for a node in the nodes2 section, you can use it for any node parsing throughout the rest of the file.
valid characters for the string: a-z,A-Z,0-9, _

for example:

[source]
----

 ;name,    x,    y,    z,     options
 ;main chassis
  0, 0.00, 0.75, 0.66

  3, 0.63, 0.36, 0.66,l
  4, 0.63, 0.75, 1.84
  another_one, 0.63, 0.36, 1.84
  hook_node, 1.48, 0.75, 0.66,lh 50
----

We advise to use the following scheme for naming the nodes: `function_section_name` so for example a rear hook node could look like this: `hook_rear_hook1`

There is also a fallback in place which will resolve named nodes to normal node numbers. For example if you convert an existing truck to named nodes (nodes2) and don't want to replace all occurrences, just leave the numbers there, it will take them up as classic node numbers.

Things to keep in mind:

* Transition from 'nodes' to 'nodes2' is easy: just replace nodes with nodes2, the numbers will act as the name strings.
* Transition from nodes2 to nodes is impossible, since nodes rely on the linear numbering of nodes.
* Only use node names without any special characters or spaces (only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, -).
* You do not need to convert all nodes to nodes2 with names, if a nodes2 named node is not found, it will fallback to using the number as classic node.

==== Beams

This section defines all the beams connecting nodes. Each line describes a beam.

Parameters::

* *node_A*: [red]#Node ID#; Connected node
* *node_B*: [red]#Node ID#; Connected node
* *options* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#String#; [lime]#default = empty#
** *v*: Dummy option, does nothing. Beams are visible by default.
** *i*: This beam is invisible.
** *r*: This beam is a rope (no resistance to compression, but will deform/break when expanded)
** *s*: This beam is a support beam (no resistance to expansion, but will deform/break when 1/10th of the damping of the last set_beam_defaults setting
* *extension_break_limit* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Positive real number#; [lime]#default = 4 * original length#; Only valid with option *s*

TIP: Support beams are very useful for limiting movement of body panels like trunks, hoods, and doors from going inside the car while still allowing rotation without costly and complicated collisions. Default expansion break length is . User set break length factor is optional. Valid factors are > 0.0. .

----

==== Cameras

This section is important. It helps to position the truck in space, by defining a local direction reference. This is used to measure the pitch and the roll of the truck. It is also very important to orient the truck's cameras.
The three parameters are node numbers. The first is the reference node and may be anywhere. The second must be behind the first (if you look at the front of the truck, it is hidden behind the first). The third must be at the left of the first (if you look to the right of the truck, it is hidden by the first).
Correct relative placement of these nodes is important, or it may break the inside camera view.

==== Cinecam

This defines the position of the in-truck camera. It is a special node suspended from eight chassis nodes. The parameters are the 3 coordinates of the point and the 8 nodes to which it is bound. Note that if your input nodes that do not exist, your vehicle will most likely explode upon spawning.
There are also two optional values to define the spring and damping factors of the links to the camera, to adjust its movements. The default values are 8000 and 800.

----

==== End

The file *must terminate* by `end` or it will crash.

=== Organizational Sections

These sections are not required, but will make it easier to locate your file or work with. Do not use carets in your syntax, they are used to mark sections!

==== GUID
you should use the guid feature to allow RoR to recognize your truck uniquely. We will use this feature later on to push truck updates to clients or skin selections.

[source]
----
;guid <GUID>
guid 6daaee29-e462-4d99-96d2-4577294f7b10
----

You can generate some GUIDs here:
http://www.guidgenerator.com/

==== Fileformatversion

This tells RoR what version of RoR your truck is built for. Most trucks built today should use "fileformatversion 3"

IMPORTANT: Version 0.4.5 contains a reworked file format parser which introduces a new format version '450' (to signify version 0.4.5.0). Earlier versions will be parsed in legacy compatibility mode.

* Version 1 = Pre-RoR 0.32
* Version 2 = RoR 0.32 - 0.35
* Version 3 = Post-RoR 0.36
* Version 450 = RoR 0.4.5.0 and later. Only vehicles made using 0.4.5's rig editor should have this version.
* Leaving out this tag will result in version 1.

==== Author


----

----

* *type*: Tells what the author referenced in the next section did. Recommended types to put: chassis, texture, support, etc.
* *AuthorID*: ID of the author's RoR Forum account, so the user may write him or her a message or view his or her other trucks. Use "-1" if he or she does not have a RoR Forum account.
** To get the AuthorID: Log into the forums and visit [http://repository.rigsofrods.com/ the Repository]. The AuthorID should be displayed on the left side.
* *authorname*: The author's name.
* *email* [silver]#(optional)#: The author's e-mail.

Each author requires a separate line.

author chassis 4    heinz_peter               heinz@mail.com
author texture 123  forname_surname_othername someuser@mail.com
author support 5487 otheruser                 otheruser@mail.com
----

IMPORTANT: *Do not use spaces* in the type, authorname, or email. Instead, use an underscore ( _ ). In the game, the underscore will be replaced with a space.

==== Description

[source]
----
description
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing
elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
dolore magna aliqua.
end_description
----

Pretty self-explanatory. *Only the first 3 lines* will get displayed in the Truck HUD. *Do not put keywords in the description*, they will mess up the truck file.

==== Fileinfo

General info about the vehicle.

* *Unique ID* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#String#; [lime]#default = -1#; [aqua]#Empty value = -1#; This field specifies the unique file ID (you get one by uploading it to the repository). http://repository.rigsofrods.com/uniqueid/[You can get a unique ID here.]
* *Category ID* [silver]#(optional)# [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Decimal number#; [lime]#default = -1#; [aqua]#Empty value = -1#; This is the category number from the repository. It is recommended that you give your truck a category.<br>[[Truck Categories|You can find a list of valid numbers here.]]
* *File version* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Decimal number#; [lime]#default = 0#; Version of the vehicle, read by users and the repository. For backwards compatibility, this field also accepts real number (a warning is reported).

[source]

; example:
fileinfo      000UID,          107,             2
----

==== Help

The help section gives the name of the material used for the help panel on the in-game dashboard. This material must be defined elsewhere in a material file. This is optional. (But it looks cool, so use it!)

NOTE: This setting can be overriden by <<guisettings>> section

----

==== Comments

Comments are ignored by RoR. They are useful for telling users what things do in the truck file.
Comments can be put anywhere by putting a semicolon ( ; ) as the first character of the line to be commented.

You can also comment out several lines of text using this format:

[source]
----
comment
One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams,
he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous vermin.
He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up
a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow-like
sections. From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off
completely, could hardly stay in place. His numerous legs, pitifully
thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly
before his eyes.

=== Vehicle-specific

The following sections define important vehicle parts, like wheels, shock absorbers, and the like.

==== Engine

The engine section contains the engine parameters.

Parameters::

* *Shift down RPM*: [red]#Real number# The engine speed at which the automatic transmission will shift down (gear 2 and up) or the clutch engages (driving off).
* *Shift up RPM*: [red]#Real number# The engine speed at which the automatic transmission will shift up. Actual redline is this value x1.25.
* *Torque*: [red]#Real number# The torque of the engine in newton-meters (N-m). The higher the value, the faster a truck will accelerate. RoR uses a flat torque model, usually correct for large intercooled turbo diesels.
* *Final Drive Ratio*: [red]#Real number# A global gear conversion ratio.
* *Rear gear ratio*: [red]#Real number# Gear ratio of reverse. For every turn of the engine, the wheels will turn this many times.
* *Neutral gear ratio*: [red]#Real number# Gear ratio of neutral gear. For organizational purposes...
* *First gear ratio*: [red]#Real number# Gear ratio of 1st gear.
* *Second/etc gear ratio*: [red]#Real number# Gear ratio of all further gears. Note there must be between 1 and 15 forward gears. The final gear *must be followed by a -1 value* (parser will emit a warning if the terminator is missing).

One good source of practical gear ratios is http://www.roadranger.com/Roadranger/productssolutions/transmissions/index.htm[Eaton Fuller]. To see the ratios, click the name of the transmission and find "Product Specifications Guide". It's wise to make sure you can get into final gear. If your vehicle decelerates in a gear you may not have enough power, or the gear ratio may be too high.

==== Engoption  ====

Engoption sets optional parameters to the engine. It is mainly used for car engines.

Parameters::

* *Engine inertia*: [red]#Real number#, [lime]#default = 10.0#. The default game value is correct for a large diesel engine. For smaller engines you probably want smaller values. 1.0 or 0.5 would be appropriate for small atmospheric engines, for instance.
* *Engine type*: [red]#One Character String#, [lime]#default = t#. Valid types are *t* for truck engine and *c* for car engine. This parameter changes engine sound and other engine characteristics.
* *Clutch Force* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2+ ]# [red]#Real number#, [lime]#default = 10000 for trucks, 5000 for cars#.
* *Shift Time*:  [silver]#(optional)#:  [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2+ ]# [red]#Positive real number#, [lime]#default = 0.2 seconds#. Time (in seconds) that it takes to shift. Requires a defined *clutch force* parameter to work.
* *Clutch Time* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2+ ]# [red]#Positive real number#, [lime]#default = 0.5 seconds#. Time (in seconds) the clutch takes to apply. Requires a defined *clutch force* parameter to work.
* *Post Shift Time* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2+ ]# [red]#Positive real number#, [lime]#default = 0.2 seconds#. Time (in seconds) until full torque is transferred. Requires a defined *clutch force* parameter to work.
* *Stall RPM* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.7+ ]# [red]#Real number#, [lime]#default = 300#. RPM where the engine will stall.
* *Idle RPM* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.7+ ]# [red]#Real number#, [lime]#default = 800#. Idle RPM the engine should attempt to maintain.
* *Max Idle Mixture* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.7+ ]# [red]#Real number#, [lime]#default = 0.2#. Defines the maximum amount of throttle the truck will use to maintain the idle RPM.
* *Min Idle Mixture* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.7+ ]# [red]#Real number#, [lime]#default = 0.0#. Defines the minimum amount of throttle the truck will use to maintain the idle RPM.

;sample shift timings for a mid size truck
----

TIP: Use the "Engine inertia" value to make the engine start faster.
With a value of 0.1, the engine will start instantly. With a value of 10, the engine requires about 30 seconds of cranking before it starts. Values between 1 and 3.5 are great for vehicles that you drive frequently, or race vehicles and the like that you want to start fast. However, using a higher value makes it harder to stall the engine. Making something to tow a lot of weight? Raise it up to 9 or 10 and it won't really stall, ever. (With values over 10, it may not start at all, so be careful.)

==== Brakes

Parameters::

* *Default braking force*: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = 30000#; This allows you to change the default braking force value. The default is 30000, which is generally too high a value for smaller cars and trucks.
* *Parking brake force* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.3+ ]# [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = (brake_force * 2)#;

==== Wheels

This section is important: it defines the wheels!

Parameters::

* *Radius*: [red]#Real number#; The radius of the wheel, in meters.
* *Width*: [red]#Real number#;This value has been ignored since 0.32, but is still required for compatibility reasons. Wheels now occupy the full distance between node1 and node2.
* *Number of rays*: [red]#Real number#;The number of 'pie pieces' that make up the wheel. For reference, "3" makes the wheel triangular, and "4" makes the wheel square. Recommended values are between 10 and 16.
* *Node 1*: [red]#Node number or name#;The node on the axle where the one side of the wheel starts.
* *Node 2*: [red]#Node number or name#;The node on the axle where one side of the wheel ends.
To clarify, if you imagine a beam that goes right through the middle of the wheel along the axis of rotation, Node 1 and Node 2 would be at the intersection between one side of the wheel and the beam and the intersection between other side of the wheel and the beam.
* *Rigidity Node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The number of a special rigidity node (see explanation about <<{baseurl}/axle-rigidity/index.adoc#,Axle Rigidity>>). Use "9999" if there is no rigidity node.
* *Wheel Braking*: [red]#Positive real number from range <0 - 4>#; "0" for unbraked wheels, "1" for braked wheels. For directional braking, as found in airplanes, use "2" for a left wheel, "3" for a right wheel. In 0.37, "4" is used for a wheel with a footbrake, but no parking brake.
* *Wheel Drive*: [red]#Positive real number from range <0 - 2>#; "0" for undriven wheels, "1" for wheels driven forwards, "2" for wheels driven backwards
* *Reference arm node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The <<{baseurl}/arm-node/index.adoc#,reference arm node>> for the wheel. This is where reaction torque is applied to the chassis. Set it to a node in front of the wheel for more traction and behind the wheel for less traction. Setting the reference arm node to the same node as *Node 1* or *Node 2* gets rid of the effects of the Reference Arm Node.
* *Mass*: [red]#Real number#; Mass of the wheel, in kilograms.
* *Springiness*: [red]#Real number#; The stiffness of the wheel, somewhat equivalent to tire pressure. Having too much spring will make the steering wheels bounce back and forth during understeer, sending vibrations through the entire vehicle.
* *Damping*: [red]#Real number#; The rebound rate of the wheel
* *Materials*: [red]#String#; Face material and band material. (no comma between them) If you don't have a custom material, use "tracks/wheelface" for the face and "tracks/wheelband1" for a single wheel or "tracks/wheelband2" for dual mounted wheels.

----


NOTE: Wheel breaking strength is set by the last Beam defaults in the truck file before the wheels section. This can help the wheel to go faster before it breaks.

NOTE: The order in which the wheels are declared is important: each consecutive pair of wheels is grouped into an axle. A truck cannot have an odd number of powered wheels, since one wheel would not be in a pair. If this happens, the odd wheel will not move.<br>

==== Wheels2


This section improves wheels by simulating both wheel tires and rims. The player is able to set tire pressure via key input.

Parameters::

* *Rim radius*: [red]#Real number#  The radius of the wheel rim in meters
* *Tyre radius*: [red]#Real number#  The radius of the tire in meters, measured from the center of the wheel.
* *Width*: [red]#Real number#  This value has been ignored since 0.32, but is still required for compatibility reasons. Wheels now occupy the full distance between node1 and node2.
* *Number of rays*:  [red]#Real number# The number of 'pie pieces', or corners, that make up the wheel. For reference, "3" makes the wheel triangular, and "4" makes the wheel square. Recommended values are between 10 and 16.
* *Node 1*: [red]#Node number or name# The node where the wheel starts.
* *Node 2*: [red]#Node number or name# The node where the wheel ends. (See <<wheels>> for an explanation of how this works.)
* *Rigidity Node*: [red]#Node number or name# The number of a special rigidity node (see <<{baseurl}/axle-rigidity/index.adoc#,Axle Rigidity explanation>>). Use "9999" if there is no rigidity node.
* *Wheel Braking*: [red]#Positive real number from range <0 - 4>#; "0" for unbraked wheels, "1" for braked wheels. For directional braking, as found in airplanes, use "2" for a left wheel, "3" for a right wheel. In 0.37, "4" is used for a wheel with a footbrake, but no parking brake.
* *Wheel Drive*: [red]#Positive real number from range <0 - 2>#; "0" for an undriven wheel, "1" for a wheel driven forwards, "2" for a wheel driven backwards.

* *Mass*: [red]#Real number#  Mass of the wheel in kilograms.
* *Rim springiness*: [red]#Real number#  The stiffness of the wheel rim.
* *Rim damping*: [red]#Real number#  The rebound rate of the wheel rim.

==== Meshwheels

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.35+]#

Mesh wheels allows you to do very nice wheels. It takes an Ogre3D mesh of a rim (the rim only, without the tire!). The mesh should be centered, and of the right size for the wheel you want to do: its outer diameter should be the same as the "rim_radius" parameter, and its width should be the same as the distance between `node1` and `node2`. The other parameters are similar to the "wheels" command, though there are a few differences.

The side value should be `l` or `r` depending on the side of the wheel, and the final parameters are the mesh name and the material for the tire. The mapping of the texture should look something like this:

image:mesh-wheel-mapping.jpg[]

Here is an example picture of a rim mesh, as it should be modeled. The tire geometry is added dynamically afterward by the game, and will flex like a real tire.

==== Meshwheels2

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.23+ ]#

This section works exactly the same way then meshwheels, except one difference.

The tread of the wheel you generate does use the meshwheels section spring and damping ratios while the rim will use the ones from the set_beam_defaults.

It enables you to make quite soft and flexing wheels, which have a lot lateral grip and are very reliable and predictable in comparison to normal meshwheels.

Very useful for flex body tires, since the *nodeflip* bug is mostly gone with this used the right way.

Use set_beam_defaults that make sense for rims (high spring, low damping) while the tires itself can be soft and have high damping values:

==== Flexbodywheels

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.55+ ]#

This section works exactly the same way then meshwheels2, except 2 differences:

There is a contactive rim generated and you can place a tire mesh which is converted to a flexbody by RoR.

For now, the rim mesh is a prop. Might be upgraded to flexbody later.

This one has complete new tire physics, so for now, happy testing, please give feedback.

==== Shocks

Shocks can be seen as tunable beams, useful for suspensions.

Parameters::

* *Node 1*: [red]#Node number or name# The node where the shock starts.
* *Node 2*: [red]#Node number or name# The node where the shock ends.
* *Spring rate*: [red]#Real number# The 'stiffness' of the shock. The higher the value, the less the shock will move for a given bump.
* *Damping*: [red]#Real number# The 'resistance to motion' of the shock. The best value is given by this equation: `[ 2 * sqrt(suspended_mass * spring_rate) ]`
* *Max contraction*: [red]#Real number# The shortest length the shock can be, as a proportion of its original length. "0" means the shock will not be able to contract at all, "1" will let it contract all the way to zero length. If the shock tries to shorten more than this value allows, it will become as rigid as a normal beam.
* *Max extension*: [red]#Real number# The longest length a shock can be, as a proportion of its original length. "0" means the shock will not be able to extend at all. "1" means the shock will be able to double its length. Higher values allow for longer extension.
* *Precompression*: [red]#Real number# Changes compression or extension of the suspension when the truck spawns. This can be used to "level" the suspension of a truck if it sags in game. The default value is 1.0.
* *Options* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#String#, [lime]#default = no options (shock is visible)#
** `i`: This shock is invisible (default is visible).
** `l` *or* `L`:  Stability active suspension for left side.
** `r` *or* `R`:  Stability active suspension for right side.
** `n`: Placeholder. Does nothing, parser ignores it silently.

IMPORTANT: Shocks2 need at least 1500+ as a minimum damping value when using them as inbound/outbound only. (When your shocks2 truck bottoms out at spawn, damping is too low (or the springs don't support the weight of the truck)

IMPORTANT: Soft bump shocks need some boundary limit ( 5%+ ) to work proper as soft bump boundaries.

NOTE: You will find any errors in the ror.log regarding to wrong values in 'M' setting or any other shock values.

.Shock swapping
====
This is an example how to get started with replacing shocks with shocks2. In this example, the shocks2 have exactly the same functionality then the original shocks. After adding the shocks2 delete the old shock and you are fine to tune/tweak your truck.

==== Animators

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.37.68+ ]#

The animator section concerns only Animators referring to game data! They are beams which change their length depending on the variables of the simulation.

Parameters::

* *Node 1* -  [red]#Node name or number# The node where the animator starts. Required
* *Node 2* - [red]#Node name or number# The node where the animator ends. Required.
* *lengthening factor* - [red]#Real number# A coefficient which specifies how much the animator moves. Required.
* *Option string* - [red]#String# Required

Options::

* *vis*: creates a visible animator. (It is not necessarily needed, but can help users read the truck file.)
* *inv*: creates an invisible animator.
* *airspeed*: extends or contracts with the actual speed (not speedometer indicated speed) for any vehicle.
* *vvi*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's vertical velocity.
* *altimeter100k*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's altitude up to 100,000 feet.
* *altimeter10k*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's altitude up to 10,000 feet, at which point it will revert back to its original length.
* *altimeter1k*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's altitude up to 1,000 feet, at which point it will revert back to its original length. These three animators can be used to create altimeters with three needles or similar objects, though for those small applications it is usually recommended that <<Add_animation>> be used.
* *aoa*: extends or contracts with the dashboard's angle of attack.
* *flap*: extends or contracts with the flap setting on the vehicle.
* *airbrake*: extends or contracts with the airbrake setting on the vehicle.
* *roll*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's roll. It will flip at 180 degrees roll to -180 degrees roll. This option can be used for an automatic trim feature.
* *pitch*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's pitch. It will flip back at 180 degrees pitch to -180 degrees pitch. This option can be used for an automatic trim feature.
* *throttle<1-8>*: extends or contracts with the throttle setting of an aircraft's first engine. This option can be used for thruster mechanics. Valid sources include throttle1, throttle2, etc. etc. up to throttle8.
* *rpm<1-8>*: extends or contracts with the RPM of an aircraft's first engine. This option can be used for thruster mechanics. Valid sources include rpm1, rpm2, etc. etc. up to rpm8.
* *aerotorq<1-8>*: extends or contracts with the torque of an aircraft's first engine. Note that this only works for propeller engines, because torque is not applicable to jets. Valid sources include aerotorq1, aerotorq2, etc. etc. up to aerotorq8.
* *aeropit<1-8>*: extends or contracts with the pitch of an aircraft's first engine. Note that this only makes sense with propeller engines, pitch is not applicable to jets. Valid sources include aeropit1, aeropit2, etc. etc. up to aerotorq8.
* *aerostatus<1-8>*: extends with the On/Off/Fire status of an aircraft's first engine. Valid sources include aerostatus1, aerostatus2, etc. etc. up to aerostatus8.
* *brakes*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's brake status.
* *accel*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's accelerator status.
* *clutch*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's clutch status.
* *speedo*: extends or contracts with the speedometer indication. It scales with the guisetting speedometer. (It is best to use it even if there is no custom overlay dashboard; it simplifies the adjustment a lot.)
* *tacho*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's RPM. It scales with guisetting tachometer. (It is best use it even if there is no custom overlay dashboard; simplifies the adjustment a lot.)
* *turbo*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's turbocharger PSI.
* *parking*: extends or contracts with the vehicle's parking brake status.
* *shifterman1*: H-shift left right animator ( Reverse | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5-6...11-12 as positions, scales with engine settings (maxGear)
* *shifterman2*: H-shift forth/back animator Reverse-2-6-8-10-12 | 1-3-5-7-9-11 as positions
* *sequential*: sequential shift animator ( i.e for tiptronic or wheel shift pedals), can be used for commands too ( no settable limits then )
* *shifterlin*: for auto transmission animations or gearselect indicators
* *torque*: simulates engine torque, useful in addition to wheel nodearms
* *difflock*: extends or contracts with the difflock status of the truck (It only works when differentials are present in the truck.)
* *rudderboat*: extends or contracts with the steering hydro on boats.
* *throttleboat*: extends or contracts with the throttle status on boats.
* *shortlimit*: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.24+ ]# adds shortbound movement limit to the animator, needs to be followed by a valid number. Limits are calculated in percentage like shocks.
* *longlimit*: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.24+ ]# adds longbound movement limit to the animator, needs to be followed by a valid number. Limits are calculated in percentage like shocks.

All options need to be connected by an vertical bar (`|`), please refer to the example below. You can stack multiple options (like: `airspeed | vvi | inv`), but it is not recommended and may result in weird behaviors. All animators are scaled to a maximum of -1/+1 as default coefficient, use the ratio setting to get the movement you want. Speed or force of the animators is NOT settable, though you can alter movement speed just with simple lever mechanics. The longer the lever arm, the slower the node will move.

To tune your torque-animator to the needs of the truck, let it just work against a stiff shock2. The harder you make the shock, the more engine-rpm torque effect you get.

Animators can use <<set_inertia_defaults>>. Inertia helps a lot to smooth instant movement like with shifters or airbrakes.

=== Behavior

These sections define behaviors for the vehicle, like command-operated hydraulics and modifications to how beams behave.

==== Commands

The commands section describes the "real" hydros, that is, those you command with the function keys. They are like beams, but their length varies depending with the function keys you press.

Parameters::

* *Node 1*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node where the command beam starts.
* *Node 2*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node where the command beam ends.
* *Rate of extension/contraction*: [red]#Real number# How fast the command beam moves.
* *Maximum contraction*: [red]#Real number# The shortest length that the command beam will try to be, as a proportion of its initial length.
* *Maximum extension*: [red]#Real number# The longest length the command beam will try to be, as a proportion of its initial length.
* *Contraction key*: [red]#Function key code (decimal number)# A number representing the function key used to control the command beam. More than one can be controlled with the same key. (See below for the keymap.)
* *Extension key*: [red]#Function key code (decimal number)# The key used to extend the command beam.
* *Option flag* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Single character#
** *i*: makes the command beam invisible.
** *r*: makes the command behave like a rope or a winch (no compression strength).
** *n*: Placeholder, does nothing (useful as filler when you need to specify description)
* *Description* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#String# A text description that tells the user what the command beam does when the it is activated. This is shown by pressing "t" ingame. There is no need to put a key in front of the text (like F1:_do_something) this will be done automatically! Writing "hide" will hide the command from the "t-screen".

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.5+]# Default keymap:

* 1 = F1

* 13 = CTRL+F1
* 14 = CTRL+F2

Note that some keymapped commands are by default assigned to Desktop commands.. i.e. ALT+F4 closes the active window (in this case the RoR render window). It is best to avoid using those buttons if at all possible.

*I have found that if you hold F4 then hold/press Alt, the window should stay open and the command will work.*

==== Commands2  ====

Improved commands.

Commands are beams which contract and extend when player presses the corresponding key combination.

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2 ]# You can specify an inertia function for your command. This reduces the swing of commands since they will operate smoothly with inertia.

Parameters::

* *Node 1*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node where the command beam starts.
* *Node 2*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node where the command beam ends.
* *Shortening rate*: [red]#Positive real number#; How fast the command beam shortens.
* *Lengthening rate*: [red]#Positive real number#; How fast the command beam lengthens.
* *Maximum contraction*: [red]#Positive real number#; The shortest length that the command beam will try to be, as a proportion of its initial length.
* *Maximum extension*: [red]#Positive real number#; The longest length the command beam will try to be, as a proportion of its initial length.
* *Shortening key*: [red]#Key code (decimal number)#; A number representing the function key needed to compress the command beam. More than one can be controlled with the same key. (see above for keymap)
* *Lengthening key*: [red]#Key code (decimal number)#; The key used to extend the command beam.
* *Option flag(s)* [silver]#(optional)#:

** *n*: Filler option, does nothing.
** *i*: Makes the command beam invisible.
** *r*: Makes the command beam behave like a rope or a winch.
** *c*: Makes the command beam auto-center: It will automatically return it to its starting position when a lengthening/shortening key is released.
** *f*: Stops the command moving faster when engine revs increase.
** *p*: Activates press-once functionality: A single press of a shortening/lengthening key will lengthen/shorten the command beam as much as possible. A second keypress of the key which started the command moving stops the automatic movement.
** *o*: is like *p*, but it will stop in the center position.

* *Description* [silver]#(optional)#: [aqua]#Placeholder = underscore '_'# A text description that tells the user what the command beam does when it is activated.  This is shown by pressing "t" ingame. There is no need to put a key in front of the text (like F1:_do_something) this will be done automatically! Writing "hide" will hide the command from the "t-screen".

* *Inertia: Start delay factor* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2+ ]#; [red]#Positive real number#; The delay upon command start. Note this isn't time in seconds, but are a factor (the lower the value, the more inertia there is)
* *Inertia: Stop delay factor* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2+ ]#; [red]#Positive real number#; The delay upon command stop. Note this isn't time in seconds, but are a factor (the lower the value, the more inertia there is)
* *Inertia: Start function* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2+ ]#; [red]#String#; Specifies what spline should be used for start. See diagram below.
* *Inertia: Stop function* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2+ ]#; [red]#String#; Specifies what spline should be used for stop. See diagram below.

* *Affects engine?* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.5+ ]#; [red]#Positive real number#; [lime]#default = 1.0#; 0 means that moving this command won't affect engine RPM, so it is independent. Value larger than 0 specifies how much engine power will be needed for this command to move.
* *Needs engine?* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.5+ ]#; [red]#Boolean#; [lime]#default = true#; value of "true" means that the command only works with a running engine. "False" means engine is not needed.

NOTE: Both commas and spaces are accepted as delimiters between parameters.

==== Rotators

Rotators are alternate commands(hydros) that allows you to do turntables, like in the base of a rotating crane. They use 10 reference nodes:

* 2 nodes to define the axis of rotation
* 4 nodes (must be a square, centered with the axis) to define the baseplate
* 4 nodes (again, a square, centered with the axis) to define the rotating plate.

Then, in a similar way to commands, comes the rate of rotation, and the numbers of the left and right function keys.

New in [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4+ ]#:

* start_delay. Real, default 0.0
* stop_delay. Real, default 0.0
* start_function.
* stop_function.
* engine_coupling. Real, default 1.0
* needs_engine. Boolean, default false

Rotators can use <<inertia>>.

The reference nodes for the baseplate and rotator plate must also match each other in order. (i.e. if you start at the front left for the base plate and work clockwise, do the same for the rotator plate!) See the example rotators code and attached picture. Both plates must be identical!

==== Forwardcommands

Forwards the command keys pressed while riding a truck to loads in close proximity. It is used to remote control the commands of a load. The load must have the *importcommands* tag.

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.5+ ]# It is also possible to toggle forwardcommands on/off for the current beam object. The standard button assignment for this is CTRL+SHIFT+F.

==== Importcommands


Enables a load to receive command keys from a manned vehicle in close proximity. The controlling vehicle must have the *forwardcommands* tag. The load only receives the keys that are pressed by the player, it must contain a commands section. Commands section for loads is defined in the same manner as in manned trucks.

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.5+ ]# It is possible to toggle importcommands on/off for the current beam object. The standard button assignment for this is CTRL+SHIFT+I.

==== Set_beam_defaults


This is not a section, but a self-contained line that can be inserted anywhere in the truck file. It changes all the beams (and the hydros and ropes) declared after this line. You can use this line many times to make different groups of beams that have different characteristics (e.g. stronger chassis, softer cab, etc.). This method is better than the *globeams* command that is now deprecated. The parameters comes on the same line, after *set_beam_defaults*. You can use the first parameters (most useful) and safely ignore the last parameters.

Optional parameters::

* *Springiness*: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = 9000000#; The overall stiffness of a beam. The higher the value the stiffer the beam.
* *Damping constant*: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = 12000#; The resistance to motion of a beam.
* *Deformation threshold constant*: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = 400000#; The amount of force that must be applied to a beam before it will not return to its original length. The lower the value, the easier it is to deform.
* *Breaking threshold constant*: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = 1000000#; The amount of force that must be applied to a beam before it will break.
* *Beam diameter* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Decimal number#; [lime]#default = 0.05#; The visual size of a beam in meters. This setting only has a visual effect. Changing it does not modify how a truck will drive.
* *Beam material* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#String#; [lime]#default = tracks/beam#.
* *Plastic deformation coefficient* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Decimal number#; [lime]#default = 0.0#; valid range: 0.0 - 1.0; This defines how elastic the deformation of a beam is. It is explained in greater detail below.

NOTE: To use default values without having to type the numbers, use "-1" in each field. Example:

[source]
----
set_beam_defaults -1, -1, -1, -1
----

Beware: Excessive spring will result in an unstable chassis. Increasing the damping will help with this, but excessive damping will crash RoR. Higher chassis mass may mitigate that problem if applicable. If you create a light car, you may want to reduce the spring, damping and deformation values to match the real, softer frame of a car, and also increase stability.

Be aware that the current default values are "overspringy", or "underdamped" for stability reasons (that is why trucks often look too springy when they fall down a slope), but on softer designs you can correct this and have a better damping ratio. Missing beam textures may make RoR unstable. Example for a car:

[source]
----
;set_beam_defaults spring, damping, deform,  break, diameter, material
set_beam_defaults 3000000,   10000, 100000, 250000,     0.02, tracks/beamblack
----

If you want to keep a rigid chassis base and drivetrain, you can do:

[source]
----
beams
;base chassis and drivetrain with the default high-strength settings
1,2
2,3
...
3,4
;car body, softer setting
set_beam_defaults 3000000, 10000, 100000, 250000
5,6
6,7
...
;return to stronger defaults for the rest (e.g. hydros)
set_beam_defaults -1, -1, -1, -1
...
----

If you want to to make something deform well (like for flexbodies), use these settings for the beam group you want to deform together with the global <<enable_advanced_deformation>> option to unleash unlimited beam physics for best results in crash deformation:

[source]
----
;set_beam_defaults spring, damping, deform,  break, diameter,         material, deform_coef
set_beam_defaults 3000000,   10000, 100000, 250000,     0.02, tracks/beamblack,         0.9
----

The plastic deformation coefficient is 0.0 by default (elastic deformation).

IMPORTANT: By setting it as property you can tune the related beam group to your needs. Valid values: 0.0 - 1.0, do not exceed that range!

A plastic deformation coefficient setting of 0.0 is close to the original beam behavior of RoR 0.36.2 (quite elastic). 1.0 is close to the maximum plastic deformation you were able to reach with the former experimental enable_advanced_deformation patch.

IMPORTANT: Never use a break setting lower then a deform setting! This will result in a beam breaking instantly when it starts deforming!

==== Set_beam_defaults_scale

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.37.92+ ]#

This is not a section, but a self-contained line that can be inserted anywhere in the truck file. It changes the scale of all following set_beam_defaults lines to a certain factor:

* *Springiness*: [red]#Decimal number#; valid range: 0 - 1
* *Damping constant*: [red]#Decimal number#; valid range: 0 - 1
* *Deformation threshold constant*: [red]#Decimal number#; valid range: 0 - 1
* *Breaking threshold constant*: [red]#Decimal number#; valid range: 0 - 1

The default is all 1 for all arguments.

[source]
----
set_beam_defaults_scale 1, 1, 1, 1
----

Example that scales spring to 50%:

[source]
----
set_beam_defaults_scale 0.5, 1, 1, 1
----


IMPORTANT: Unlike set_beam_defaults, you must always give all four arguments. Its not possible to leave some out.

NOTE: Any set_beam_defaults line that is scaled will output a line to RoR.log saying `Due to using set_beam_defaults_scale, this set_beam_defaults was interpreted as ...`

==== Set_node_defaults

This is not a section, but a self-contained line that can be inserted anywhere in the truck file. It changes the nodes (including wheel and camera nodes) declared after this line. You can use this line many times to make different groups of nodes that have different characteristics (e.g. more grip for wheels, more surface drag for chassis nodes, etc.). The parameters comes on the same line, after `set_node_defaults`.

Merged into RoR SVN Revision 746, it is available in the RoR-Stream/updater service as "use experimental" setting in the new installer service.
You can use the first parameters (most useful) and safely ignore the last parameters. If they are not defined then default settings apply.

Parameters::

* *loadweight*: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = 0#; The default loadweight mass applied to a node. Will be overridden by a per node definition (the option `l`). Adds loadweight to following nodes. Minimass calculation is unaffected.
* *friction*: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = 1.0#; Coefficient to lower/raise friction of a node which alters its traction abilities.
* *volume*: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = 1.0#; Coefficient to lower/raise buoyancy of a node, this only applies when the node is in a fluid.
* *surface*: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = 1.0#; Coefficient to lower/raise the surface of a node, this only applies when the node is in a fluid*.
* *options*: Set any node-option property as default. You do not need to set the `l` property if a default loadweight is set.

IMPORTANT: Buoyancy volume and drag surface settings only have effect on fluids defined in groundmodels.cfg (mud definitions), so right now they do not work with the standard RoR Water.

To use default values without having to type the numbers, use `-1` in each field. For example:

[source]
----
set_node_defaults -1, -1, -1, -1
----


IMPORTANT: Excessive friction, surface and volume will result in an unstable node/beam structure when driving in mud.
If your wheels/truck explodes when driving from solid ground onto mud, lower the friction and/or volume setting. If a wheel cracks while in the mud, lower the volume and/or the surface setting.

[source]
----
; syntax is set_node_defaults loadweight, traction, buoyancy, surface
;mud tire example, unloaded, increased traction, higher buoyancy, higher drag surface and set to extra per node buoyancy

The new `L` node option will help to understand and use set_node_defaults , `p` node option will boost fps even with tracked vehicles on slower computers. -> <<nodes>>

==== Enable_advanced_deformation

This is not a section, but a self-contained line that can be inserted anywhere in the truck file. It changes the general beams deformation physics.

Use this only once per truck file, it's a general activation and setting of advanced beam physics&nbsp;.
Its recommended to place the enable_advanced_deformation before the first beams section in your truck-file.

Truck file syntax:

[source]
----
enable_advanced_deformation
----

This will remove any limit and thresholds from the <<set_beam_defaults>> processing.
Its recommended to use it for the development of properly deforming flexbody node\beam structures.

==== Rollon

Enables collision between wheels and the contactable textured surfaces of a truck.

==== Triggers

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.18+ ]#

Triggers are special beams which trigger user-specified events when extended/contracted to a given bound. They have no physics attributes and can extend indefinitely.

Parameters::

* *Node 1*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node where the trigger beam starts.
* *Node 2*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node where the trigger beam ends.
* *contraction_trigger_limit*: [red]#Real number#; The length when the shortkey command gets triggered
**extension_trigger_limit*: [red]#Real number#; The length when the longkey command gets triggered
* *shortbound_trigger_action*: [red]#Positive or negative decimal number#; On normal triggers without a special option this represents the command key to be triggered at shortbound (1 - 48 [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.7+ ]# 1 - 84). For other trigger types, look below.
* *longbound_trigger_action*: [red]#Positive or negative decimal number#; On normal triggers without a special option this represents the command key to be triggered at longbound (1 - 48 [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.7+ ]# 1 - 84). For other trigger types, look below.
* *options* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#String#
** *i*: Makes the trigger beam invisible
** *c*: Set the boundary calculation to command-style, just for convenience
** *x*: Set the trigger to disabled on startup ( default = enabled ), will get useless after first activation by a triggerblocker
** *b*: Blocks other commandkeys, shortkey at shortbound, longkey at longbound. If longkey is set to -1, shortkey will get blocked at short and at longbound. It does not block of manual user inputs, just triggers.
** *B*: Blocks other triggers when triggered, a number in shortkey represent the number of triggers to block at shortbound , a number in longkey the number of triggers to release at longbound.
** *A*: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.23+ ]# Same as the Blocker "B", but inverted activation. Will block while between shotbound and longbound  a number of triggers (shortkey) and release if not (longkey).
** *s*: Switches commandnumbers when triggered set in shortkey and longkey. Good to build wipers or similar, see examples
** *h*: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.26+ ]# You can use triggers to lock or unlock hookgroups ( only hookgroups <= -3 ); Unlocks hookgroups shortkey at shortbound and hookgroup longkey at longbound.
** *H*: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.26+ ]# You can use triggers to lock or unlock hookgroups ( only hookgroups <= -3 ); Locks hookgroups shortkey at shortbound and hookgroup longkey at longbound.
** *t*: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.7+ ]# Continuous trigger, delivers a value of "0" below and at shortbound, a value of "1" over and at longbound. Between these boundaries, this trigger will deliver a value between "0" and "1" (linear), depending on the current position. See "engine trigger" for details on how to use this.
** *E*: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.7+ ]# Engine trigger. This trigger gives you control over various vehicle driving functions. It is recommended to use this in combination with a "t"-trigger to get precise, continous control. Works as follows:
*** * ''(remapped)'' shortbound_trigger_action*: [red]#Positive decimal number# Takes the number of the engine to be controlled, starting with "0". As RoR only supports one engine per vehicle at the moment, always put "0" here.
*** * ''(remapped)'' longbound_trigger_action*: [red]#Positive decimal number# Takes the number of the function you want to control:
**** *0*: Clutch
**** *1*: Brake
**** *2*: Accelerator
**** *3*: RPM Control (not available at the moment)
**** *4*: Shift Up (use no "t"-trigger here). Will shift up on short and longbound.
**** *5*: Shift Down (use no "t"-trigger here). Will shift down on short and longbound.
** *boundary_timer* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Positive real number#; [lime]#default = 1.0#; Represents the time a boundarycheck is disabled for trigger switches ( option "s" ) to avoid lockup.

==== Lockgroups

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.26+ ]#

This section defines lockgroups for nodes. It has to be AFTER the nodes section

Lockgroup Default = -1, all nodes can be locked by standard hooks with no special lockgroup set

*Important:*
*''Special lockgroup'': 9999 skip the node from any locking attempts
*''POSITIVE'' lockgroups are free to use, the negative range is reserved for RoR built in standard lock-setups.

         2,  7, 6, 9
----

Performance boost option ( needs to be BEFORE the nodes section ):
[source]
----
lockgroup_default_nolock
----

This will set all nodes to 9999 (deny locking) of the truck by default.

Any lockgroups defined later in the truck will override this setting for the specified node.

Allows you to define exactly where standard hooks can lock to your truck and boost performance a lot when autolock hooks are used.

*It is recommended to use this option as default.*

==== Hooks

This section defines special options for hooknodes setup in the nodes section. It has to be placed after the nodes section.

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.26+ ]#

Parameters::

* *ID*: A node number to identify the hooknode the options apply to. The node number needs to exist and it has to be a hooknode with option `h`.

Named parameters::

* `hookrange`: [red]#Positive decimal number#; [lime]#default = 0.4#; The range a hook scans for a valid node to lock to.
* `speedcoef`: [red]#Positive decimal number#; [lime]#default = 1.0#; The speed a hook pulls the node to lock into locking position.
* `maxforce`: [red]#Positive decimal number#; [lime]#default = 100000000.0#; The force limit where a locking attempt is cancelled.
* `hookgroup`: [red]#Signed integer#; [lime]#default = -1#; The hookgroup a hook belongs to. Standard hook: -1, Reserved for autolock: -2, any special hookgroup for triggerd hooks -3 or less.
* `lockgroup`: [red]#Signed integer#; [lime]#default = -1#; The lockgroup a hook belongs to. Lock everything: -1, all other numbers the hook will lock only to a node with the same lockgroup set. Only signed integer are valid

IMPORTANT: Lockgroup 9999 is reseved for nodes that are skipped while locking attempts. *Do NOT use lockgroup 9999 with a hook.*

* `timer`: [red]#Positive decimal number#; [lime]#default = 5.0#; Delay timer for autolocking hooks before they attempt to relock.
* `shortlimit`: [red]#Positive decimal number#; [lime]#default = 0.0#; Minimum range in meters the hook will pull the node to lock to.

Options::

* `self-lock`: This hook can lock to the truck its placed on too.
* `auto-lock`: This hook will lock automatically to valid nodes in range.
* `nodisable`: When the force limit defined by maxforce is exceed the locking attempt will NOT disable  the linkage beam, but the hook node will stop pulling the node to lock. Works similar to ties then.
* `norope`: Linkage between hook and node to be locked will act like a beam and not like a rope.
* `visible`: Linkage between hook and node will be visible while locking process and locked.

Standard hooks toggle with `L`, autolock and triggerd hooks detach with `ALT+L` manually.

Hooks with hookgroups < -2 can only be locked automatically or by a trigger.

==== Slide Nodes

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.3+ ]#

These are nodes which can slide freely along a 'rail', which is a sequence of connected beams. It's a simple constraining mechanism that introduces new possibilities into RoR and simplifies many existing mechanical structures.

There are 2 ways to define a rail:

* To specify it in `slidenodes` section as a second parameter.
* To specify it in `railgroup` section and reference it in `slidenodes` using `railgroup_id` parameter.

A slidenode without a rail is invalid, naturally.

Parameters::

* *slide_node*: [red]#Node number or name#; A node to become slide-node.
* *rail_nodes (<u>sequence</u>)* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Comma-separated list of nodes#; [lime]#default = none, expects `railgroup_id` to be used#; Nodes forming a rail the node can slide along. Each two consecutive nodes from this list must have a beam defined between them; for example a list containing {7, 8, 9, 10} would require beams {7 - 8}, {8 - 9}, {9 - 10} to be defined.
* *s (spring_rate)* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Real number prefixed with 's' or 'S'#; [lime]#default = 9000000#; Force that holds the node to the rail (in N/m). Write as: s10.98
* *b (break_force)* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Real number prefixed with 'b' or 'B'#; [lime]#default = infinity (never)#; Force at which the node will separate from the rail (in N). Write as: b10.98
* *t (tolerance)* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Real number prefixed with 't' or 'T'#; [lime]#default = 0#; Distance from the rail before rail forces are applied to the node.
* *g (railgroup_id)* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Positive decimal prefixed with 'g' or 'G'#; [lime]#default = none, expects `rail_nodes` to be used.#; `railgroup` defining a rail. Write as: g2
* *r (attachment_rate)* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4+ ]# [red]#Real number prefixed with 'r' or 'R'#; [lime]#default = disabled#; Attachment rate in seconds. Write as: r2.3
* *d (max_attachment_distance)* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4+ ]# [red]#Real number prefixed with 'd' or 'D'#; [lime]#default = 0.1#; Maximum attachment Distance in meters. Write as: d0.23
* *q (quantity)* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4+ ]# [red]#Real number prefixed with 'q' or 'Q'#; [lime]#default = infinity#; Ignored by parser. Original meaning: number of beams the node can slide along.
* *c (attachment_constraints)* [silver]#(optional)#: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4+ ]# [red]#Two character string: [c|C] + [a|f|s|n]#; [lime]#default = none#
** *a*: Attach all.
** *f*: Attach foreign.
** *s*: Attach self.
** *n*: Attach none.

==== Rail Groups

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.3+ ]#

Allows specifying a separate rail which can be linked to slidenode(s) later.

Parameters::

* *rail_group_id*: [red]#Positive decimal number#; ID of this railgroup.
* *rail_nodes ([underline]##sequence##)*: [red]#Comma-separated list of [nodes/node-ranges]#; Nodes forming a rail the node can slide along. Each two consecutive nodes from this list must have a beam defined between them; for example a list containing {7, 8, 9, 10} would require beams {7 - 8}, {8 - 9}, {9 - 10} to be defined. Ranges are supported (for example: 1-10)

==== Detacher_group

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.23+ ]#

This section defines group of the beams that are deleted if one beam in this group breaks.

Very useful for detaching parts of the truck like bumpers, doors, wheels etc. falling of the truck when crashing.

All kinds of beams can be set to a detacher_group except wheel generation section, these one will always be "default" to avoid deleting the axle of the wheel which results in a crash.

*Valid detacher group numbers:* any positive or negative integer

*Valid end lines:* Detacher_group 0, Detacher_group end

Group 0 its the default setting and means *no group* set and is used to end groups.

Use positive group numbers for master beams and negative ones for minor beams.

A master detacher-beam breaking will brake all beams with the sames group number and all minor beams with the same negative group number (abs(detacher_group)).

A minor beam will not break any other beams at all, its just set to break with a group of beams if a master detacher-beam in its group breaks.

This will add beams 0,1 + 6,8 + 7,9 + 10,12 to group 1, beam 16,17 to group 1(minor) and beam 11, 13 to group 2.
Breaking beam 16,17 will not break any other beam.
Breaking beam 6,8 i.e, will break and disable beams 0,1 + 7,9 + 10,12 + 16,17 too in the same simulation cycle.

==== Ropes

Ropes are special beams that have no compression strength (they can shorten easily) but have standard extension strength, like a cable or a chain. They have also another peculiarity: the second node can "grab" the nearest reachable ropable node with the 'O' key. Standard use is to use a chassis node as the first node, and a "free" node as the second node (free as in not attached by any other beam). The best example of this are the chains of the Multibennes truck.

==== Fixes

Fixes are nodes that are fixed in place. That means that once put in place in the terrain, they will never move, whatever happens. This is useful for making fixed scenery elements from beams, like bridges. Just add the node number that you want to fix.

==== Minimass

This sets the minimum node mass. Useful for very light vehicles with lots of nodes (e.g. small airplanes).

TIP: When using a very low minimass, i.e. below 10, you should use a low damping value in the Beam defaults in your beams section (see <<Set beam defaults>>):

==== Ties

Ties are special beams that have no compression strength (they can shorten easily) but have standard extension strength, like a cable or a chain.

Like ropes, ties grab the nearest reachable ropable node with the 'O' key. But there is a twist: unlike ropes, they disappear when not attached (because they have no extremity node at rest) and they automatically shorten until the extension forces reaches a threshold. They are very useful to solidly strap a load to a chassis.

Parameters::

* *Root node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The root node (the starting point of the beam).
* *Max. reach length*: [red]#Real number#; The maximum reach length.
* *Auto shorten rate*: [red]#Real number#; The rate of auto-shortening.
* *Min. length*: [red]#Real number#; The shortest length possible (proportional to original length; 1.0 means no shortening).
* *Max. length*: [red]#Real number#; The greatest length possible (proportional to original length; 1.0 means no extension; recommended you keep it as 1.0).
* *Options* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#String#; [lime]#default = n#.
** *n*: Visible (default).
** *i*: Invisible.
* *Max. stress* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = 12000#; The force (in Newtons) when the ties stop to shorten.
* *Group* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Positive decimal number#; [lime]#default = none#.

Parameters::

* *Node ID*: [red]#Unsigned integer#.
* *Group*: [red]#Integer#; [lime]#default = -1#; Group to assign ropable to, -1 means all groups.

==== Torque Curve
[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2+ ]#

Torque curves affect the behavior of the engine. This section allows you to assign predefined or user-defined torque curve to a truck. It can be used in 2 ways:

===== Usage #1: Predefined curve

* *curve_name*: [red]#Torque curve name#; [lime]#default = default#; Predefined options are: `default, diesel, turbodiesel, gas, turbogas, wheelloader, compacttractor, tractor, hydrostatic`.

[source]
----
torquecurve
turbogas
----

===== Usage #2: Defining custom curve

* *power*: [red]#Real number#; RPM where the power begins
* *torque_percentage*: [red]#Real number#; Power as a percent of total torque

It's suitable to define the torque to the engine RPM set in the engine definition plus 25% (multiply the value with 1.25) to get the overev area defined.

The following example would be good for a maximum engine RPM set to 2800:

[source]
----
torquecurve
   0, 0.00
1000, 0.79
1500, 0.90
2000, 0.97
2500, 0.99
3000, 0.90
3500, 0.77
----

Engine dying in idle and first gear? Just define a single higher peak value where you want the engine to idle... like adding

[source]
----
...
700, 0.2
800, 0.6
900, 0.4
...
----

image:torque-curve.png

to the example above in the right spot will result the engine idle a little bit higher then 800 rpm in first gear.

The example to the left shows a screenshot of a torquecurve made for a small diesel engine:

Idle: ~600 RPM, Max @ 1900 RPM, slight and constant torque increase over the used RPM bandwidth, hard torque drop off in the over-rev area.

==== Cruise Control

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.39.7+ ]#

This section offers options to the cruise control feature:
*lower limit: Sets the minimum speed cruise control can be activated. Unit is meters per second (divide kph by 3.6. Example: 36 kph/3.6 =10 mps)
*auto brake: If activated, the vehicle breaks if velocity is faster than set in cruise control. 0=auto brake off,  1=auto brake on

[source]
----
;cruisecontrol lowlimit autobrake
cruisecontrol        10         1
----
In the example above, minimum speed for cruise control to be activated is 10mps (36kph). The auto brake feature is activated.

==== Speedlimiter

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.39.7+ ]#

Limits the speed of a vehicle. If the speed is above the limit, the vehicle will not accelerate any further. Insert the limit in meters per second (divide km/h by 3.6. Example: 36 km/h / 3.6 = 10 m/s)

[source]
----
;speedlimiter <speed in m/s>
speedlimiter 10
----
In the example above, the maximum speed of the vehicle is 10mps (36kph), it will not accelerate any further.


==== Axles

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36.2+ ]#

This section defines axles on a vehicle, allowing more accurate distribution of torque among the wheels.

Sample axle section

[source]
----
axles
w1(1 2), w2(3 4), d(ol) ; axle 1
w1(5 6), w2(7 8), d(l) ; axle 2
----

The axle section introduces open differentials, and spooled (aka locked) differentials. By adding axles to your vehicle file you override the propulsed property for the tires. Only wheels connected to an axle are powered, if multiple axles are defined the axles are interconnected in a locked manner. If no axle section is defined the old model of equal power distribution is used. Because the axle sections looks up already defined wheels, *it must be defined AFTER the wheels have been defined.*

The axle section is different from other sections in that it is broken into properties. Properties are not order dependent.

Properties::

* `w1(<node1><node2>)`: defines which wheel the axle is attached to, &lt;node1&gt; and &lt;node2&gt; Refer to the node1 and node2 as defined in the wheel section
* `w2(<node1><node2>)`: wheel 2, same as w1, this is the second wheel attached to the axle. w1 and w2 are interchangeable.
* `d(<list of diff types>)`: defines the available differential types for this axle. the list of axles is cycled through in the order specified, differential types maybe specified more than once. Each differential type is specified by a single letter, the letters are not to be separated by spaces or any other character. If no differentials are specified  the axles will default to opened and locked.
** `o` - open
** `l` - locked
** `s` - Split evenly (each wheel gets equal torque regardless of wheel speed)


==== Collisionboxes ====
[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4.0.5+ ]#

In RoR 0.4.0.5 and above you can define collisionboxes. In earlier versions of RoR, there was only one bounding box for truck activation per object, which was defined by the outermost nodes. With collisionboxes, you get the ability to define the nodes that should be used for the activation bounding box calculation. It is also possible to define multiple bounding boxes, for example to exclude some areas from activation.

Syntax:

[source]
----
collisionboxes
;node id list box 1
48, 58, 59, 67
;node id list box 2
5, 6
...
;node id list box n
...
----

Collisionboxes can give you a huge performance increase in situations where many beam objects would have been activated before, for example a container crane with many containers underneath.

==== Rescuer  ====

[source]
----
rescuer
----

This single keyword placed in the truck file will make the truck a rescuer, like the Scania Wrecker. These vehicles can be entered by pressing `R`.

==== Managedmaterials  ====

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36+ ]#

Managed materials helps you to use complex material effects (for example reflective materials like chromes, dynamic damage materials, bumpmapped materials) without having to deal with the technical complexity of writing a shader for Ogre3D. Rigs of Rods comes with a set of standard shader effects, and with the Managedmaterial section you can pick the effect you want and adapt it for your vehicle. The shader library will grow with time, so the set of effects available in this section will grow with time.

The generic format of this section is&nbsp;:

* *Material name* - the name of the material you are creating. You can use this material for any of your meshes (flexmeshes, props, etc.). This material name *must not be defined anywhere else* (for example in a .material file).
* *Effect name* - the name of the effect you want to use. Valid names are defined below.
* *Effect parameters* - a variable number of parameters, depending on the effect your are using. See below for the description.

Do not use a comma to separate parameters in a managedmaterial section! Also, you must declare your managed material before they are used. That means that the managedmaterial section should come before the flexmesh, props, wheels, or any section that will use this material.

Currently available effects:

* *flexmesh_standard* - This effect defines an opaque, reflective and damageable material for flexmeshes. This will work only for flexmeshes! It takes 3 parameters:

** A standard texture name: this is the base, undamaged texture. (The diffuse map.)
** A damaged texture name (or "-" if no damage texture): Should be similar to the standard texture, but with damage.
** A specular map texture name (or "-" if no specular map texture): a greyscale image that maps the "shinyness" of the material, from dark for matte to white for chromed. Technically this isn't a specular map but a reflectivity map.

* *flexmesh_transparent* - This effect defines a semi-transparent, reflective and damageable material for flexmeshes. This will work only for flexmeshes! It takes 3 parameters:

** A standard texture name: this is the base, undamaged texture. The alpha channel of this texture is used to define transparency. (The diffuse map.)
** A damaged texture name (or "-" if no damage texture): Should be similar to the standard texture, but with damage.
** A specular map texture name (or "-" if no specular map texture): A greyscale image that maps the "shinyness" of the material, from dark for matte to white for chromed. Again, technically this isn't a specular map but instead a reflectivity map.

* *mesh_standard* - This effect defines an opaque, reflective material for any mesh (like wheel rims, props, etc.) It takes 2 parameters:

** a standard texture name: This is the base texture.
** a specular map texture name (or "-" if no specular map texture): A greyscale image that maps the "shinyness" of the material, from dark for matte to white for chromed.

* *mesh_transparent* - This effect defines a semi-transparent, reflective material for any mesh (like wheel rims, props, etc.) It takes 2 parameters:

** a standard texture name: This is the base, undamaged texture. The alpha channel of this texture is used to define transparency.
** a specular map texture name (or "-" if no specular map texture): A greyscale image that maps the "shinyness" of the material, from dark for matte to white for chromed.

WARNING: Your texture file names must not start with "-". The parser would treat the "-" as "no texture placeholder" and ignore the rest.

----

A note about shaders for power-users: you can still use your own, non managed, Cg shaders by manually defining your .material, .program and .cg. Consult the Ogre3D documentation for more details. If you think you have made a good shader that can be helpful to other modders, submit it to the game authors (Thomas or Pricorde) for inclusion to the managedmaterial library of RoR.

==== Set_managedmaterials_options ====

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.37.92+ ]#

This specifies options for all [underline]##FOLLOWING## managed material lines.

Parameters::

* *doublesided*: [red]#0 (single sided) or 1 (double sided)#; [lime]#default = 0 (single sided)#; . Determines if the mesh should be visible from both sides or not.<br>IMPORTANT: This parameter treats 1 as "yes" and anything else as "no". This is required for backwards compatibility.

==== Flares

Flares allow you to add lights to your truck. They work as light sources in OGRE and will illuminate other objects (if enabled in settings).

_See also: <<{baseurl}/flares-tutorial/index.adoc#,Flares Tutorial>>_

Parameters::

* *Reference node*: [red]#Node ID#; Node which defines origin of flare-placement coordinate system
* *X axis node*: [red]#Node ID#; Node which defines X-axis of flare-placement coordinate system
* *Y axis node*: [red]#Node ID#; Node which defines Y-axis of flare-placement coordinate system
* *Flare X offset*: [red]#Real number#; Flare position on X axis in % of distance from ref-node to X-node
* *Flare Y offset*: [red]#Real number#; Flare position on Y axis in % of distance from ref-node to Y-node
* *Type*: [red]#Character#; [lime]#default = f (headlight)#; Type of flare
** `f`: Headlight.
** `b`: Brakelight.
** `l`: Left blinker.
** `r`: Right blinker.
** `R`: Reverse light (on when driving in R gear)
** `u`: User controlled light. (i.e. fog light) (see controlnumbers))
* *Control number*: [red]#Decimal number#; - This determines how this light is switched on and off, if you chose a user controlled light. Valid user defined control numbers are 0-500. If you chose a non-user controlled light(i.e. brake light) you should put "-1" here. <br>Some custom control numbers found in 0.38:
** 11 Clutch
** 12 Parking Brake
** 40 Stater
** 45 Axle Lock
** 55 Steer right
** 56 Steer left
** 65 Hide GUI
* *Blink delay (miliseconds)*: [red]#Decimal number#; [lime]#default = -1 (500 ms)#; This defines how long the delay is between the light changes in milliseconds. A value of 500 means that the light is 500ms on and 500ms off. Use a value of "-1" to use the default value of 500ms. Use a value of 0 to create a non-blinking light.
* *Flare size*: [red]#Real number#;  This determines how big the flare will be. Reasonable values are between 0.1 and 5 (0.1 = 10% of default size). If the size is smaller then 0, then the flare will be independent of the camera angle. (So the flare does not get smaller when you move the camera)
* *Material Name*: [red]#String#; This field determines what material should be used for the flare display. If you want to use the standard material, use *default*. Please note that there is not comma between the material name and the size argument. You can use ''tracks/aimflare'' to position your flare.

----

==== Materialflarebindings

This can bind a material to a flare, so that the material changes with the flare's on/off status.

The format is as follows:

* *flare number*: Counting starts from zero. Just count down your flares in the flares section to find the correct number.
* *material name*: The material that you want to change. It must contain one technique, one pass and a special Texture Unit State (see below for an example)

[source]
----
flares
51,1,79, 0.23, 0.50, b, -1, 300, 0.2 myTruck/MyBrakeFlare

materialflarebindings
1, myBrakeMaterial
----

The material must use an animated texture, as shown below:

[source]
----
material myBrakeMaterial
{
	technique
	{
		pass
		{
			texture_unit
			{
				anim_texture truck_brake_material.png 2 0
			}
		}
	}
}
----

Put the off-state of the brakelight into the file "truck_brake_material_0.png" and the on-state into "truck_brake_material_1.png". The 2 and 0 at the end should not be changed.

This section should be after the flares section and before the props and flexbodies section in order for the lights to work properly.

==== Props

This allows you to "stick" any 3D mesh to a triangle of points of a truck. You can use it to stick air intakes, horns, seats, dashboard, bumpers, whatever to the truck. Note that there will be no collision detection with these objects. Like flares, they use a vector coordinate system instead of normal right-angle coordinates. Props are positioned relative to 3 nodes of the chassis: One node is the reference node, and the two others define a base (x,y). Props are positioned relative to the reference node by adding proportions of the vectors ref-&gt;X, ref-&gt;Y, with the normal being used as well .

Please read this guide if you want to use high quality meshes: [[Mesh LODs]].

Parameters::
* *reference_node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The base node, used to define the coordinate system
* *x_direction_node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node that defines the X direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the *reference node* to this node)
* *y_direction_node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node that defines the Y direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the *reference node* to this node)
* *x_offset*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#;  The amount the prop should be moved in the X direction from the *reference node*. The distance it is moved depends on the distance between the *Reference node* and the *X direction node *(it's proportional): (0) leaves the prop on the reference node, (1) moves it all the way to the *X direction node*, and (0.5) puts the prop half-way between the two
* *y_offset*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#;  The amount the prop should be moved in the Y direction from the *reference node*. Like the *X direction offset*, the amount it is proportional to the distance between the *reference node* and the *Y direction node*.
* *z_offset*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#;  Imagine a surface which the X and Y directions pass straight through. If looking along that surface is the forwards direction, then this field moves the prop straight up. Unlike the *X direction offset* and the *Y direction offset*, the amount for the straight up offset is measured in meters
* *x_axis_rotation*: [red]#Real number#;  The amount the prop should be rotated about the X axis
* *y_axis_rotation*: [red]#Real number#;  The amount the prop should be rotated about the Y axis
* *z_axis_rotation*: [red]#Real number#;  The amount the prop should be rotated about the 'straight up' axis
* *mesh_name_or_special_prop*: [red]#String (may start with a keyword)#; The name of the Ogre3D mesh object used for the prop. <br>If the mesh name starts with one of the following keywords, it will have special behavior:
** [maroon]#"dashboard"#: A custom dashboard + steering wheel mesh. See below.
** [maroon]#"dashboard-rh"#: A custom dashboard +steering wheel mesh on right side. See below.
** [maroon]#"leftmirror"#: Left rear view mirror.
** [maroon]#"rightmirror"#: Right rear view mirror.
** [maroon]#"seat"#: Driver's seat: Positions the driver character and turns translucent if appropriate. Skins the prop using material "driversseat"
** [maroon]#"seat2"#: Driver's seat: Same as "seat" except it doesn't force the "driversseat" material.
** [maroon]#"beacon"#: A beacon. Color and flare material are adjustable (default = orange)
** [maroon]#"redbeacon"#: A red beacon which flashes red. Fixed color and flare material.
** [maroon]#"lightbar"#: Police lightbar beacon, flashes red and blue (fixed). Also marks the vehicle as "police car" and sets up some special sounds and controls.
** [maroon]#"spinprop"#: Undocumented :-(

Please note that if you want to stick wheel meshes on a wheel, the third node has to be taken from one of the outer segments.

----

Note:

* The *X offset* and the *Y offset* should logically between 0 and 1, or  if the body flexes too much the prop will not stick to the body correctly.<br>
* The coordinate system is actually really similar to 'normal coordinates', but it allows the angle between the two axes (ie. the angle between the *X node*, the *Reference node*, and the *Y node*) to be any value, not just 90 degrees. If that angle can be made to be 90 degrees, then the weird coordinate system will turn into 'normal coordinates'. This can be used to make prop placement easier.

* Beacon [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.35+ ]# (to change the beacon's color and flare material)If you want to use you own mesh as beacon it should be named `beacon<somename>.mesh`, e.g. `beacon-blue.mesh`. The only difference between this and a standard beacon is the flarematerialname e.g. tracks/redbeaconflare which sets the color of the light, and the RGB value of the flash (The last three numbers), that sets the color of the light that is reflected from objects when the beacon lights them.

WARNING: All special parameters are required, otherwise none of them will take effect.

==== Add_animation  ====

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.37.68+ ]#

This directive adds an animation to last defined prop.  Up to *10* rotations and offsets depending on different sources can be used on one prop.

Parameters::
* *Ratio*: [red]#Real number#; A coefficient for the animation, prop degree if used with *mode: rotation* and propoffset if used with* mode: offset*.

* *Lower limit*: [red]#Real number#; [aqua]#Empty value = 0#; The lower limit for the animation, remember to use a negative value when source can be negative (as in wheel steering.) Use *0* for both options to get default limits (Full circle rotation ( -180/+180??) or -10/+10 for offsets. Limits always apply to the props' spawning position.

* *Upper limit*: [red]#Real number#; [aqua]#Empty value = 0#; Upper Limiter for movement, remember to use a positive value when source can be negative (as in wheel steering.). Use *0* for both options to get default limits ( Full circle rotation (-180/+180??) or -10/+10 for offsets. Limits always apply to the props' spawning position.

Attributes::
** `source`: [red]#String#; sources to use, it is recommended to use only 1 per add_animation line, though multiple sources are possible too.

** `mode`: [red]#String#; modes to use, multiple modes are valid.

** `event`: [red]#String#; optional input, only needed for `source: event`. It determines the keypress event to catch for the animation.

Keywords::
* *autoanimate* [silver]#(optional)#: rotation or offset is applied as long as source is not 0. Useful for driveshafts, fans, etc.

* *noflip* [silver]#(optional)#: a prop will flip to the opposite limit when a limit is reached, with this mode it just stops at the set limit.

* *bounce* [silver]#(optional)#: a prop will flip to the opposite limit when a limit is reached, with this mode it just rebound at the set limit. Only useful with `mode: noflip`.

* *eventlock* [silver]#(optional)#: will lock a toggled event in its current sttus, useful for switches and staus levers. Only works with `mode: event` and a correct defined `event:`.

Source types::
** `airspeed`: actual speed (not speedometer indicated speed) for any vehicle.
** `vvi`: vehicle's vertical velocity.
** `altimeter100k`: vehicle's altitude up to 100,000 feet.
** `altimeter10k`: vehicle's altitude up to 10,000 feet, at which point it will revert back to its original length.
** `altimeter1k`: vehicle's altitude up to 1,000 feet, at which point it will revert back to its original length. These three animators can be used to create altimeters with three needles or similar objects/
** `aoa`: dashboard's angle of attack.
** `flap`: flap setting on the vehicle.
** `airbrake`: airbrake setting on the vehicle.
** `roll`: vehicle's roll. It will flip at 180 degrees roll to -180 degrees roll. This option can be used for an automatic trim feature.
** `pitch`: vehicle's pitch. It will flip back at 180 degrees pitch to -180 degrees pitch. This option can be used for an automatic trim feature.
** `throttle1`: throttle setting of an aircraft's first engine. This option can be used for thruster mechanics. Valid sources include throttle1, throttle2, etc. etc. up to throttle8.
** `rpm<1-8>`: RPM of an aircraft's first engine. This option can be used for thruster mechanics. Valid sources include rpm1, rpm2, etc. etc. up to rpm8.
** `aerotorq<1-8>`: torque of an aircraft's first engine. Note that this only works for propeller engines, because torque is not applicable to jets. Valid sources include aerotorq1, aerotorq2, etc. etc. up to aerotorq8.
** `aeropit<1-8>`: pitch of an aircraft's first engine. Note that this only makes sense with propeller engines, pitch is not applicable to jets. Valid sources include aeropit1, aeropit2, etc. etc. up to aerotorq8.
** `aerostatus<1-8>`: On/Off/Fire status of an aircraft's first engine. Valid sources include aerostatus1, aerostatus2, etc. etc. up to aerostatus8.
** `brakes`: vehicle's brake status.

** `tacho`: vehicle's RPM. It scales with guisetting tachometer. (It is best use it even if there is no custom overlay dashboard; simplifies the adjustment a lot.)
** `turbo`: vehicle's turbocharger PSI.
** `parking`: vehicle's parking brake status.
** `shifterman1`: H-shift left/right ( Reverse | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5-6...11-12 as positions, scales with engine settings (maxGear)
** `shifterman2`: H-shift forth/back animator Reverse-2-6-8-10-12 | 1-3-5-7-9-11 as positions
** `sequential`: sequentiell shift ( i.e for tiptronic or wheel shift pedals), can be used for commands too (no settable limits then)
** `shifterlin`: for auto transmission animations or gearselect indicators (special limits rules apply for this one, see below!)

WARNING
====
GIMBAL LOCK::
To avoid axis corruption when rotating props:
- Always place your prop with a y-rotation of 0 or 180??. If you need to align your prop in another way, rotate the mesh in your mesh-editor!
To avoid axis corruption when rotating multiple props:
- Use only the x and y axis together, skip z. If you need 3 axis rotation, do the z-axis with a n/b-rotator as the base for your prop definition nodes.

==== Flexbodies

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36+ ]#

Flexbodies are pretty much the same as props. The only difference between them is that flexbodies deform.

You can declare several flexbodies. Each must be composed of the two lines (prop-like line and forset line).

===== (sub-section) "Prop-like"

The first line of this section is exactly the same format as on the props section.

Parameters::
* *Reference node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The base node, used to define the coordinate system. If you want to place your flexbody globally, declare -1 as the reference node.
* *X direction node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node that defines the X direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the *reference node* to this node).
* *Y direction node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node that defines the Y direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the *reference node* to this node).
* *X offset*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#;  The amount the prop should be moved in the X direction from the *reference node*.
* *Y offset*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#;  The amount the prop should be moved in the Y direction from the *reference node*.
* *Z offset (m)*: [red]#Real number#; Moves the flexbody "straight up". Unlike the *X offset* and the *Y offset*, the distance is measured in meters.
* *X rotation*: [red]#Real number#;  The amount the flexbody should be rotated about the X axis.
* *Y rotation*: [red]#Real number#;  The amount the flexbody should be rotated about the Y axis.
* *Z rotation*: [red]#Real number#;  The amount the flexbody should be rotated about the 'straight up' axis.
* *Mesh name*: [red]#String#; The name of the Ogre3D mesh object used for the flexbody.

===== (sub-directive) forset

Next, a line beginning with the word `forset` follows. After the word `forset` you declare all nodes used for the deformation of the mesh (ranges are supported).

* *Node list*: [red]#List of nodes{number/name/range}#; List of nodes to use for deforming the flexbody. These nodes should be outer nodes of the vehicle, those that are close to the mesh.

Notes about backwards compatibility:
* If you use a node range [A-B], RoR will tolerate if node B doesn't exist (warning will be emitted).
* If you enter multiple commas ",," between forset entries, parser will ignore it silently.
* If there's a comma after last element, parser will ignore it silently.

===== (sub-directive) disable_flexbody_shadow
[silver]#(optional)# [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.8+ ]#

No parameters. Disables shadow casting of the last flexbody to improve complex truck FPS.

===== (sub-directive) flexbody_camera_mode
[silver]#(optional)# [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.8+ ]#

Sets the cameramode in which the flexbody should be shown:

* *Mode*: [red]#Decimal number# [lime]#default = -2 (always visible)#; Flexbody visibility: -2 = all the time, -1 = external only, >=0 = cinecam number.

IMPORTANT: Keep an eye on the number of vertices of your meshes. Not that there is a hard limit, but beyond 10000 vertices there could be a noticeable slowdown. As reference: the Dodge mesh is about 4000 vertices.

==== Submesh

Defines the most visible part of the truck: the body. It will dress the chassis with solid triangles. You must define each body panel (a continuous almost-flat section) in a different submesh section, in order to have sharp body angles, and to simplify texturing.

Most modern flexbodied trucks do not need a submesh section for visual purposes. However, the section is still required for collision to work.

A submesh has two subsections: `texcoords`, that places nodes of the submesh on the texture image (coordinates between 0.0 and 1.0), and `cab`, that draws the triangles, with triplets of node numbers.

===== (sub-section) texcoords
* *Node*: [red]#Node number#; Node representing a vertex in the resulting geometry.
* *U*: [red]#Decimal number 0.0 - 1.0#; The U texture coordinate: Position of this vertex on the X axis of the image.
* *V*: [red]#Decimal number 0.0 - 1.0#; The V texture coordinate: Position of this vertex on the Y axis of the image.

===== (sub-section) cab
* *Node_1*: [red]#Node number#; Node representing a vertex 1 in the resulting geometry. Must be present in the `texcoords` subsection.
* *Node 2*: [red]#Node number#; Node representing a vertex 2 in the resulting geometry. Must be present in the `texcoords` subsection.
* *Node 2*: [red]#Node number#; Node representing a vertex 2 in the resulting geometry. Must be present in the `texcoords` subsection.
* *options* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#String#
** `n`: Placeholder. Does nothing.
** `c`: This triangle will be a contact triangle that can contact with contacters nodes.
** `b`: This triangle will be part of a buoyant hull.
** `s`: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4+ ]# This triangle will be part of a buoyant hull, mouse dragging will be disabled.
** `r`: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.4+ ]# This triangle will be part of a buoyant hull, mouse dragging only.
** `D`: (Combination of  *b* and *c* flags) This triangle will be both a contact triangle AND a buoyant hull part.
** `p`: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36a+ ]# Makes the force required to pierce through the submesh triangle ten times bigger.
** `u`: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36a+ ]# Makes it impossible to pierce the submesh.
** `F`: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36a+ ]# Same as `p` but also a boat hull.
** `S`: [yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36a+ ]# Same as `u` but also a boat hull.

The order in which the three points forming the triangles is given is important, as its winding defines in which direction it will be visible. The winding must be counterclockwise to be visible.

* <<{baseurl}/texturing-tutorial/index.adoc#,Texturing Tutorial>> that describes how to fill the submesh and cab parts of the truck file.

===== (sub-directive) backmesh

No params. If added, the triangles' backsides will be black instead of see-through.

==== Set_skeleton_settings


Inline-section; modifies the skeleton display of the truck. Has module-wide effect; only needs to be issued once per file.

Parameters:
* *visibility_range_in_meters* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Real number#;  [lime]#default = 150#;   [aqua]#Empty value = -1#

* *beam_thickness_in_meters* [silver]#(optional) (nullable)#: [red]#Real number#;     [lime]#default = 0.01 (1 centimeter)#; [aqua]#Empty value = -1#

==== Videocamera

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.38.19+ ]#

The videocamera section describes how to set up multiple mirrors and extra cameras like a backup-camera for a truck or hook-camera for a crane.
Both, cameras and mirrors, use the same technique, cameras just add a reflective calculation and flip (mirror) the image generated.

Parameters::
* *Reference node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node where the camera is placed. This is your reference node. Any existing node# is valid.
* *Left node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The Z-reference of the camera, should be exactly right of the reference node when the camera points forward to the trucks front. Any existing node# is valid.
* *Bottom node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The Y-reference of the camera, should be exactly below the  reference node when the camera points forward to the trucks front. Any existing node# is valid.
* *Alternative reference node* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Node number or name#; [aqua]#Empty value = -1#; The alternative cam position node. It replaces the reference node for position but not for orientation. Good to setup mirrors and cams with just one extra node to an existing truck. Important for mirrors, read below!   Any existing node# is valid.
* *Alternative orientation node* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Node number or name#; [aqua]#Empty value = -1#; The alternative camera orientation node. If set, it skips any camera orientation calculation and makes the cam permanent look at the set node. Good for hooks moving up and down. Any existing node# is valid.
* *X offset* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Real number#; [aqua]#Empty value = 0#; X-offset from reference or alternative cam position node. Works like props offsets, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum  and moves the cam proportional forth and back on its roll-axis.
* *Y offset* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Real number#; [aqua]#Empty value = 0#; Y-offset from reference or alternative cam position node. Works like props offsets, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum  and moves the cam up and down in meters on its rotation-axis.
* *Z offset* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Real number#; [aqua]#Empty value = 0#; Z-offset from reference or alternative cam position node. Works like props offsets, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum  and moves the cam proportional left and right on its pitch-axis.
* *X rotation* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Real number#; [aqua]#Empty value = 0#; Optional camera X-rotation. Works like props rotation, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum. Adjust camera orientation without moving nodes.
* *Y rotation* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Real number#; [aqua]#Empty value = 0#; Optional camera Y-rotation. Works like props rotation, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum. Adjust camera orientation without moving nodes.  Avoid the gimbal lock, using Y-rotation is not recommended together with other axis.
* *Z rotation* [silver]#(nullable)#: [red]#Real number#; [aqua]#Empty value = 0#; Optional camera Z-rotation. Works like props rotation, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum. Adjust camera orientation without moving nodes.
* *FOV*: [red]#Real number, valid: 0.01 -179.9#; Camera field of view.
* *Texture width*: [red]#Positive decimal, must be power of 2#; X-resolution of the texture generated. Valid: any value^2 (POW) (see below for explanation), recommended maximum 256, watch your FPS.
* *Texture height*: [red]#Positive decimal, must be power of 2#; Y-resolution of the texture generated. Valid: any value^2 (POW) (see below for explanation), recommended maximum 256, watch your FPS.
* *Minimum clip distance*: [red]#Real number#; Minimum distance in meters of objects to be rendered Valid: 0.1 - value<maxclipdistance. Useful to blend out things that should not be displayed. Good to tune FPS.
* *Maximum clip distance*: [red]#Real number# Maximum distance in meters of objects to be rendered Valid: value>minclipdistance - 32000. Useful to blend out things that should not be displayed. Watch your FPS.
* *Camera role*: [red]#Decimal number#; Role aka function of the camera: *-1* == camera, *0* == tracker camera (requires an alternative camera orientation node), *1* == mirrors.
* *Camera mode*: [red]#Decimal number, use -2#; Camera switchoff state. Not supported yet, put a *-2* in here.
* *Material*: [red]#String#; The material the generated textured should be displayed on. Requires a prop (mesh) using this material to get any visual results.
* *Name*: [yellow-background]#[ Version  0.38.63+ ]# [red]#String#; Specify a name for this videocamera that might be used for the title of the renderwindow.

IMPORTANT: .material file material definition is strictly necessary and needs to match the material in the truck-file line. Material definition features a fall-back texture when camera is not active or not set. Just add a texture unit with a texture definition, it will be replaced with the generated texture when camera is setup correct and active automatically.

IMPORTANT: Place the videocamera section *before loading any meshes* that should display the material

IMPORTANT: It's recommended that mirrors always use the alternative cam position node placed precise in the center of the mirror-mesh (the reflecting part) of the related mirror. Otherwise, reflective calculation might be wrong. Mirrors can use y-axis rotation presets for easy adjustment, to rotate x/z axis move the reference nodes accordingly to avoid gimbal lock, offset preset work too, but are not recommended to use.

WARNING: Wrong or not existing materials will make RoR crash while parsing the truck. Be accurate !

WARNING: Do *NOT* the set alternative camera orientation node to the same node# then your reference node or ( if used ) the alternative cam position node. Makes no sense and might crash.

Debug mode::
Setting `VideoCameraDebug=Yes` in RoR.cfg activates helpful meshes which show position and orientation of the video-cameras set up.

==== Extcamera
The extcamera command allows you to change the 3rd person camera behavior.

Currently, there are three modes you can use:

* Classic mode (also default if you do not use this command)

[source]
----
extcamera classic
----

* Cinecam mode: it will rotate the camera around the cinecamera

[source]
----
extcamera cinecam
----

* Node mode: it will rotate the camera around a specified node

[source]
----
extcamera node <nodeid>
;for example:
extcamera node 123
----

The final two modes are useful for a vehicle with detaching parts, so the camera is fixed in the view of the main vehicle.

==== Camerarail

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.39.7+ ]#

You can add a camerarail section to your beam objects. The camerarail generates a cSpline on base of the given nodes, on which you can move a camera. A new camera mode will be added ingame which is accessible with the "c"-button.

Camera controls::
* `RMB`: Rotate camera.
* `RMB+LEFTCTRL+MOUSELEFT/MOUSERIGHT`: Move camera on spline. Speed up with Shift or slow down with Alt.
* `LEFTCTRL+SHIFT+SPACE`: Enable/disable auto-tracking.

Syntax:

[source]
----
camerarail
<node1>
[node2]
...
[node50]
----

You can define up to 50 nodes per beam object. You can use one node several times. If the first node is the same as the last one, the spline will be closed and the camera can move on the rail continuously.

Example:

[source]
----
camerarail
5
6
7
8
5
----

If multiple beam objects, each with a "camerarail"-section, are connected with hooks, the game will try to connect the splines. This way you can move the camera over multiple hooked vehicles without the need to switch the vehicle:

`Object A (active) - Object B (hooked) - Object C (hooked)`

The distance between the last camerarail node of one and the first camerarail node of another object needs to be under 5 meters.

==== Envmap

This section is currently not used. It has no effect putting anything there. However, it may be used in future versions.

=== Sounds

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.36+ ]#

Vehicles can also have custom sounds. By default, RoR uses a set of default sounds for your vehicle, but with the following sections you can customize these sounds.

==== disabledefaultsounds

Use this simple statement to disable all sounds that RoR automatically adds to your vehicle. This allows you to start from a clean slate, and add your custom sounds without interference from the automatically added sounds.

[source]
----
disabledefaultsounds

==== Soundsources

Adds a sound source to your vehicle.

Parameters:
* *Node ID*: [red]#Node number#; The place where your sound will come from. Doesn't support named nodes.
* *Sound script name*: [red]#String#; Sound scripts are defined in <<{baseurl}/soundscript-files/index.adoc#,soundscript files>>. You can use game-defined sound scripts or your own sound scripts.

Special wing formats to reduce node/beam count and CPU load::

[source]
----
 (Use at own risk!)

All examples lines refer to the node notation sample picture above.
 'A' means Node A from that schematic diagram.
They work, no idea if they produce more or less lift then a wing with defined thickness.
Only use them for invisible wings with meshed props/flexbodies for the visual appearance and with a transparent material, skinning them results in an ugly visual appearance.
----

Flarewing using 2 nodes::
* For precise aviation flare placement you can use a wing defined with only 2 nodes.
* It has no aerodynamic influence at all It has an extremely low node/beam count

IMPORTANT: Needs to be placed as first wing in the wings section. Use the NACA0009.afl as the airfoil.

Trim or main wing using 3 nodes::

* Defines a wing using only 3 nodes.
* Placing this wing first in the wing section results in the aviation flares appearing on the nodes A,B ( red/green ) and E (white flash).
* Works horizontally and vertically. (As on the tail.).
* Low node/beam count wing for self built flaps, ailerons, elevators or trimwings, very easy to animate with a single hydro.
* Can be used with any active control surface and any afl-format.
* Known Issues: Sometimes vertical tailfin wings work only one direction. If RoR crashes exchange node A and B with each other.

==== Airbrakes

[yellow-background]#[ Version 0.35+ ]#

Airbrakes are a moving panel used to slow down an airplane (key bindings: "3" and "4"). They are positioned similarly to "props". These airbrakes can be easily added to a wing box, with noderef, nodex, nodey and nodea being the four upper nodes of a box.

Parameters::
* *reference_node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The base node, used to define the coordinate system
* *x_direction_node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node that defines the X direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the *reference node* to this node)
* *y_direction_node*: [red]#Node number or name#; The node that defines the Y direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the *reference node* to this node)
* *additional_node*: [red]#Node number or name#; An additional node to make the braking forces symmetric (they are applied to noderef, nodex, nodey and nodea).
* *x_offset*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#;  The amount the prop should be moved in the X direction from the *reference node*. The distance it is moved depends on the distance between the *Reference node* and the *X direction node *(it's proportional): (0) leaves the prop on the reference node, (1) moves it all the way to the *X direction node*, and (0.5) puts the prop half-way between the two
* *y_offset*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#;  The amount the prop should be moved in the Y direction from the *reference node*. Like the *X direction offset*, the amount it is proportional to the distance between the *reference node* and the *Y direction node*.
* *z_offset*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#;  Imagine a surface which the X and Y directions pass straight through. If looking along that surface is the forwards direction, then this field moves the prop straight up. Unlike the *X direction offset* and the *Y direction offset*, the amount for the straight up offset is measured in meters
* *width*: [red]#Real number#;   Dimension of the panel
* *height*: [red]#Real number#;  Dimension of the panel
* *max_inclination_angle*: [red]#Real number#;  Maximum inclination angle
* *texcoord_x1*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#; Texture coordinate.
* *texcoord_y1*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#; Texture coordinate.
* *texcoord_x2*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#; Texture coordinate.
* *texcoord_y2*: [red]#Real number <0 - 1>#; Texture coordinate.
* *lift_coefficient* [silver]#(optional)#: [red]#Real number#; [lime]#default = -1.0#

==== Turboprops  ====


The turboprops section defines the turboprop engines, and makes the truck a plane!

It is important that this section comes AFTER the props section, because you will need to add a 'spinprop.mesh' entry to the props before turboiprops will work. One pale.mesh per propeller blade can also be aded for visible blades. Easy, eh? Each prop blade is associated to a blade tip node, and you must ensure the blade nodes are correctly interconnected with beams so it will spin freely around its axis, while maintaining a rigid prop disc. See how the Antonov is made. You can also make 2 or 3 blade props by putting a "-1" instead of the blade tip node number(see the Twin Otter for example). Parameters are:

* *reference_node*:    [red]#Node number or name#; Center of the prop
* *axis_node*:            [red]#Node number or name#; Back of the prop
* *blade_1_tip_node*: [red]#Node number or name#;
* *blade_2_tip_node*: [red]#Node number or name#;
* *blade_3_tip_node*: [red]#Node number or name#;
* *blade_4_tip_node*: [red]#Node number or name#;
* *turbine_power*:     [red]#Real number#;            Power of the turbine (in kW)
* *airfoil*:                  [red]#String#;                     Airfoil of the blades

==== Fusedrag  ====


The fusedrag section helps the correct modeling of the fuselage contribution to the aerodynamic drag of a plane. It also makes possible the "masking" of the aerodynamic contribution of an object loaded inside the plane. It models the fuselage as a big wing section, with an airfoil (usually a symmetrical airfoil like NACA0009). Fusedrag can also be used in road vehicles to aid top speed. The parameters are:

**Number of the front-most node of the fuselage*
**Number of the rear-most node of the fuselage*
**Approximate width of the fuselage*
**Airfoil name*

==== Pistonprops

Pistonprops act in almost the exact same way as turboprops minus two differences. The pitch is manually set and stays at a set value and it has a couplenode.

Parameters::
* *reference_node*:    [red]#Node number or name#; Center of the prop
* *axis_node*:            [red]#Node number or name#; Back of the prop

=== Boats

==== Screwprops

Screwprops are boats' propellers. As of RoR 0.31, the definition of this section is not stabilized, and is bound to change as the propeller model will improve. Currently, steering is only done by thrust vectoring. The current format is prop node, back node, top node, power.

set_collision_range is 0.02 as default value, and defines the maximum range (2 cm) around a truck's collision triangles that collisions start to happen. By increasing it, for example to 0.04, penetrations become a lot more difficult.
