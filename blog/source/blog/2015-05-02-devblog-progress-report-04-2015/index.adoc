*Hello RoR fans!*

Another 2 months have passed and 1 new progress report is here! It turned out everyone (including me) was so busy in march that barely any development happenned and I had no time to write a blog post (plus, nothing new to write about, really  ). Fortunately, April has been much more relaxed and I've been able to do some very important progress. All of my latest changes are incorportated in link:http://www.rigsofrods.com/threads/119110-Test-Build-Rigs-of-rods-0-4-5-0-dev[0.4.5.0-dev test build 2] - I encourage everyone to test!

== Vehicle compatibility status

...has improved! I tested with many more vehicles and I re-thought my approach to parser design. For one thing, I began loosening the very strict syntax checking which was causing vehicles to spawn crippled and littered the "spawner report" window with loads of warning messages. Very common mistakes, such as extra commas at the ends of lines, trailing comments (yes, they weren't legit), invalid flags and bad lettercase of keywords is now tolerated, often silently without warning message. Further, I began adding "fallback" method of parsing for lines which don't make it through the syntax check - in this case, parser will emit a warning and process the line by means of RoR v0.38/v0.4.0.7 - unsafe, but mostly workable. So far, "nodes/nodes2" were augumented this way.

But most importantly, I changed my philosophical approach to processing the .truck format. From the very start, I knew that the parsing process used in 0.4.0.7 has to change, both to clear the way for further development of RoR's physics (the old parser was seriously blocking it), and also because I wanted to equip RoR with a built-in rig editor. However, at the same time, I needed to maintain compatibility with existing content. Until now, I've been trying to write a parser which would satisfy both requirements. It didn't really work, most vehicles got broken and I wasted a lot of words rambling about how bad was both the code and the truckfiles. But about a week ago, I finally concluded the parser I wrote suits my needs, but it will never fit together with existing content. After realizing this, it was obvious what I have to do: <<{baseurl}/docs/truck-description-file/index.adoc#Fileformatversion,Declare a new fileformatversion>> for future content, and write an importer component for content with lower fileformatversion. For the new fileformatversion number, I chose "450", to resemble version number 0.4.5.0 and also to signify it works differently than older numbers (1,2,3) - those were just informational and the parser ignored them. My fileformatversion actually makes a big difference.

Nonetheless, I began bumping into prevailing v0.38 -> v0.4.0.7 incompatibilities, such as this one. Those will be harder to tackle because the code of version 0.38 is 4 years old and uses outdated dependencies, so it'll take some time to create a working dev version for testing and investigation. I'll try my best, but no promises at this point.

Again, I encourage everyone to link:http://www.rigsofrods.com/threads/119110-Test-Build-Rigs-of-rods-0-4-5-0-dev[download a test build and check his favourite vehicles]. They should work a lot better now.

== Rig editor status

The editor is still not usable, but it's progressing steadily. This time, I added support for wheels (meshwheels2 + flexbodywheels so far). There's a selection menu in the top menubar and panels which can alter wheel parameters. Changes to wheel size or number of rays are displayed immediately and you can select + edit multiple wheels at the same time. There's also an option to create a new rig from scratch and the "engine" panel was equipped with [add engine]/[remove engine] buttons which were missing before. The N/B editing controls are still not complete (you can delete beams, but you can't add them yet), but work is being done. Further, the wheel-subsystem components (selection menu, highlight boxes, panels) were created as generic, so there will soon be similarly implemented support for flares, props, wings and more features.

Anyway, at this point, some of you may legitimately question my efforts to create the rig editor. Although it's a nice thing to have, it doesn't seem to be really needed, modders have been happily creating content using existing methods and without any apparent issues, as link:http://www.rigsofrods.com/threads/118966-Prop-placement-Program[this forum thread] shows. So, do I have good reason to burn a lot of time working on the editor when there are much more serious flaws to tackle? I believe so, and you deserve to know it.

== Physics of the future

Currently, RoR can handle roughly 500 nodes + 3000 beams per vehicle. With so few elements, it's reasonable to do this work manually. However, this system leaves a lot to be desired - the soft body physics model (with weighted nodes acting like joints + weightless beams + stability requirements) is very hard and unnatural for a human to work with. Also, the RoR handles only enough N/B to create a grid-like chassis where 3d models can be attached (props, flexbodies).

Now imagine I created a completely new physics engine which could handle roughly *ten times more N/B* than the current engine (think *5 000 nodes* and *30 000 beams*). These numbers must sound insane to RoR veterans, but I have good technical reasons to believe such performance can be achieved. Further details aside, you'll agree with me that creating so detailed N/B by hand (or in Blender, or Editorizer, or any other similar method) will become humanly impossible. Further, such performance increase will deserve new approach to N/B architecture - instead of modelling a vehicle as a whole, it will be possible to model individual components (rigid frame, soft interior, heavy rigid engine, outer chassis components, possibly a rollcage) and then join them to create more reallistic deformation behavior.

There is only one way to deal with such a modding challenge - using a CAD-like editor where the vehicle can be modelled the way technical engineers do - by defining real-world shapes of components, materials and means of joining components together. The editor would then compute the best fit N/B to simulate such vehicle. And THAT is precisely where I'm headed in my rig-editor efforts. Currently, the editor has only partial support for hand-editing the N/B, but that's just something to start with and an utility for current modders + current content. But I'm really looking into the future, and the future is CAD.

Naturally, this is only an enthusiast project done in people's free time. It may not succeed. But I'll incorporate enough scripting support to spread the implementation complexity among members of the comunnity, so everything will be achievable. I'm optimistic.

Until then, please bear with me.
