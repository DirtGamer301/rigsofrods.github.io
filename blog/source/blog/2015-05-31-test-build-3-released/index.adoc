Say hello to the new test build! Changelog:

only_a_ptr::
* fixed 0.4.0.7's malformed flexbodies bug. Flexbodies were spawned deformed, see screenshots in link:https://github.com/RigsOfRods/rigs-of-rods/issues/16[this ticket]. I fixed it by simply backporting flexbody code from 0.38.67 (last stable release). However, I'm a little worried about performance impact, the code uses precise but expensive calculations.
* Added built-in profiler. I incorporated link:https://floodyberry.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/high-performance-cplusplus-profiling/[this library] into RoR. It works by putting tracking macros in the code (so called instrumentation) and generates a very nice HTML output. I've added instrumentation for RigSpawner class (per-function) and FlexBody generation (constructor, detailed). Profiling configuration is found in header RigLoadingProfilerControl.h. Feel free to add your own instrumentation and control headers.
* Added ror.cfg option to disable flexbody LODs By profiling, I discovered that the slowest part of vehicle loading are flexbodies, but not their generation, but seeking flexbody-LOD files in OGRE's resource system (mega slow, scheduled for elimination by OGRE team). I added a ror.cfg option to disable this.
* Added flexbody cache support After disabling the flexbody LODs, the slowest part of rig loading was flexbody generation. To speed things up, I implemented a caching support for flexbodies - first time the vehicle is loaded, a file "flexbodies_mod_MODNUMBER.dat" is generated in cache, and subsequent spawns of the same vehicle load it.


Other than that:

* I have improved flexbodies calculation, they are faster, even faster than 0.4.0.7:

* RoRConfig is also updated to support 0.4.5.0's features. (like Skidmarks)

* PSSM shadows are included in this release but they are badly glitched.

We hope you can enjoy this and help us improve RoR!
