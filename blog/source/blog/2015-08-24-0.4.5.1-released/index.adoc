Hello folks 

The dev team is happy to the first bugfix release of the 0.4.5 NextStable series. It contains several fixes that didn't make it to 0.4.5.0 in time or were discovered after NextStable release.

== 0.4.5.1
Changelog::
* Fixed crash on driving through railway switches.
* Added shadows support to more default models.
* Removed unneeded text from notice box.
* Improved shadows quality.
* Updated textures.

=== Get it
Windows build can be downloaded from GitHub. Current RoR Windows playets can also use the updater shipped with 0.4.5 to upgrade.

Linux users can use <<{baseurl}/docs/linux-scripts/index.adoc#,automated scripts>> to download and build the latest snapshot.



Thank you for playing Rigs of Rods and we hope you enjoy the NextStable release series.
