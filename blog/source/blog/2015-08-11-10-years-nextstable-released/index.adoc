Dear Rigs of Rods community,

Today is a special day for all of us. On this day, http://rigsofrods.blogspot.com/2005/08/ror-011-ready-for-download.html[10 years ago], the first version of Rigs of Rods soft body physics simulator was released to the public by Pierre Michel-Ricordel (known as pricorde).

Rigs of Rods started as a tech demo. It demonstrated something that was unexpected at this time: the simulation of Spring-Mass-Damper systems in real time. Luckily for all of us development did not stop there. Now, 10 years and many milestones later, Rigs of Rods can simulate trucks, trains, submarines, boats, planes, helicopters, motorbikes, Mars rovers and perhaps other things yet to be discovered.

Without doubt one of the key reasons why Rigs of Rods achieved this success is its open-source nature and its community. As it grew, many developers, moderators, modders and administrators have contributed their time, skills and knowledge to the project. A special shout out goes to our fellow modders who remained committed to creating content for the game and thus keeping it alive for all these years.

The Rigs of Rods Team is proud to present another stable release exactly 10 years after the first public release.

== Version 0.4.5.0

Major changes from 0.38.67::
* A main menu!
* GUI overhaul
* new .truck file parser
* new terrain format
* simple AI available through Angelscript API
* added simulation of turbochargers
* many bug fixes as usual

The full changelog can be found <<{baseurl}/download/changelog/index.adoc#,here>>

Important notes::
* Due to the new terrain system old terrains which were not made for 0.4.0.6 or higher are not compatible anymore. However, many old terrains have already been converted and new exciting ones have been speficially designed for 0.4.

You can find terrains for RoR 0.4 and higher here::

* terrains converted from 0.38: http://www.rigsofrods.com/threads/109425[Updated-terrains-for-0-4-0-7-no-more-updates]
* If you want to convert an old terrain which hasn't been converted by someone else this may be useful to you: <<{baseurl}/docs/terrain-system/index.adoc#upgrading_to_current_terrain_system,Upgrading to current terrain system>>

* The new .truck parser is compatible with the old .truck format but more strict about syntax compared to the old parser. This is necessary to avoid ambiguous statements. All vehicle creators should check their creations with the new parser and eliminate syntax flaws. Thanks!

Thank you for playing RoR and we hope you like the NextStable release series!
