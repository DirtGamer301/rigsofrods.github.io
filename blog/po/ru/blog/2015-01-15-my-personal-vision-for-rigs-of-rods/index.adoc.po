"I would like to see RoR going much faster than it currently does. RoR is "
"usually limited by the CPU as it has to do a lot of floating point math to "
"simulate the behaviour of beams and nodes. Other limiting factors probably "
"are memory latency and bandwidth since structures for beams and nodes are "
"quite large in size and there are hundreds of them per vehicle. Besides the "
"fact that the whole phsyics core could use a cleanup it is also required "
"that we increase accuracy (discussion: link:http://www.rigsofrods.com/"
"threads/118051-Discussion-Moving-to-double-precision-for-physics[Discussion-"
"Moving-to-double-precision-for-physics]) to improve the quality of the "
"simulation. When we do that a major overhaul of the physics core is needed "
"which would be a great chance to improve performance as well. I believe that "
"there is more room for parallelization and that we should use it whenever "
"possible. In the best case RoR should be able to max out any number of CPU "
"cores while still running significantly faster on a single core than it does "
"now."

"Besides a speedup in performance I would also like to see the physics "
"calculations being moved to the server. The details are unclear yet because "
"it would suddenly increase server hardware requirements a lot. Maybe we will "
"have an option to toggle serverside physics on and off.  The major benefit "
"of serverside physics calculation is that multiplayer collisions are "
"possible, something that many have asked for and I want to see happening "
"myself. It would also lead to a clear separation between client and server, "
"potentially putting less stress on the client than before. We will have to "
"see how much that could be since some calculations will probably still be "
"needed clientside for movement predicition to reduce perceived lag. It would "
"certainly seperate rendering and physics though, already increasing "
"performance."

"I got access to an 80-core cluster computer. My ultimate goal is that the "
"RoR server (with physics calculations being serverside) is able to take "
"advantage of such a system. I would like to see it being able to make use of "
"all cluster nodes using OpenMPI to spread physics calculations across all "
"cores so we can potentially have many people spawning many vehicles in one "
"multiplayer session. In case this becomes possible I may host a community "
"event, hosting a RoR server on said cluster for an evening to have a big "
"wreck fest. It's still uncertain if this is possible at all. The possible "
"degree of parallelization for the physics core has yet to be determined. "
"When working with clusters additional problems arise like latency and "
"bandwidth for communication between nodes. The latency could be large enough "
"to make this whole project fail but since a similar project probably has "
"never been done before we can't know for certain until we tried."
