"Another month has passed and it's time for me to write a progress report. In "
"fact, the report is already slightly overdue because I've been really busy "
"lately and I could only hardly follow RoR development. However, there are "
"several other active developers and a growing number of testers and bug-"
"reporters, so the project is steadily improving."

"To shortly iterate what's been hapenning: I've been working on rig editor, "
"specifically adding panels to edit properties of nodes/beams and other beam "
"types. Currently I'm adding support for all types of wheels, including the "
"possibility to add/edit/delete wheels. I've also started several "
"experimental dev branches oriented on performance and more maintainable "
"code.  Hiradur continues to improve linux compatibility and maintains the "
"multitude of RoR dependencies.  Aperion has returned to what he's good at - "
"improving the very core of the gameplay, the physics simulation. So far, "
"he's only been doing careful cleanups not to disrupt the upcoming stable "
"release, but there seems to be a lot to look forward to.  Max98 is "
"simultaneously improving many player-oriented aspects of the game, ranging "
"from UI and HUD through enviromental improvements like skies and water to "
"signifficant gameplay fixes."

"The major development problem regarding this project is vehicle support. In "
"the past, version 0.4.0.x broke compatibility with older vehicles and forced "
"modders to double-release their new content. Then I came and broke things "
"further, despite I claimed to improve it. Up to now I wasn't able to "
"completely restore all broken features, although situation is improving. "
"Recently, RoR got a new window which displays all errors and warnings about "
"about loaded vehicles. Thanks to Max98, the messages are also colored. This "
"window will inform players what's wrong with their favorite vehicles and "
"also help modders to avoid risky or unsupported practices."

"I'd like to explain the cause of the current situation. When I analyzed "
"RoR's vehicle loading code back in 2013, I discovered that the problem is in "
"the design of the format - modders can define various parts of the vehicle "
"(beams, nodes, wheels, cinecam, rotators, triggers, more wheels, more beams) "
"in an arbitrary order, possibly interleaving things, and the parser will "
"process all of it in the exact order. A software like this is a programmer's "
"inferno because it's impossible to tell how exactly things are going depend "
"on each other, how they will interact and what side effects may arise. Since "
"RoR's vehicles were quite feature rich and features were built on top of one "
"another, the amout of possible scenarios was astronomic. To name a few "
"cases, I've seen vehicles defining some nodes, then defining wheels (which "
"generate nodes) and then define more nodes. But hey, nodes have numbers, and "
"if you auto-generate nodes in between, are you sure your numbering will "
"continue correctly? Further, some modders attached beams to nodes before "
"those were defined, or to nodes which were auto-generated by different "
"sections (or possibly never generated). How is a programmer supposed to "
"check if the connection is correct? To make things worse, there's the half-"
"baked 'named nodes' feature (nodes2). More than half of truckfile sections "
"don't support them, but at the same time, named nodes can still be reffered "
"to with numbers, so modders did it that way. As a result, a programmer sees "
"code trying to look for node 123 and he has no idea where that node will "
"come from. Impossible to work with. Despite all these alarming facts, RoR "
"vehicles have been working happily... until original authors left, along "
"with the knowledge of all quirks and obscure mechanisms of the vehicle "
"support. Un-involved coder didn't stand a chance. That's why 0.4.0x became "
"incompatible with 0.38, and only problems followed."

"My solution to this issue was developing new vehicle parser: one that would "
"read all data first and only then process them, in a given order, to avoid "
"all unexpected results. From software design standpoint, this is an only "
"plausible solution. Unfortunately, this approach broke all vehicles which "
"relied on the quirky nature of the old parser. In addition of that, many "
"bugs were introducted in the process, because RoR's vehicle format is very "
"feature-rich and I was a new coder to the project. So far, I've been able to "
"track and fix many of those bugs and also detect and work-around many legacy "
"requirements of older vehicles. I had been hoping to work around everything, "
"however, I've arrived to a point where some vehicles directly conflict with "
"my parser's architecture. And even thoug I'd really love to make everything "
"work, I'm not willing to compromise future development by making "
"compatibility hacks into my code. Some content will just have to go."
