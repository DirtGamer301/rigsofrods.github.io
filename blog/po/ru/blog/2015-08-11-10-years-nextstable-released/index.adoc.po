"Rigs of Rods started as a tech demo. It demonstrated something that was "
"unexpected at this time: the simulation of Spring-Mass-Damper systems in "
"real time. Luckily for all of us development did not stop there. Now, 10 "
"years and many milestones later, Rigs of Rods can simulate trucks, trains, "
"submarines, boats, planes, helicopters, motorbikes, Mars rovers and perhaps "
"other things yet to be discovered."

"Without doubt one of the key reasons why Rigs of Rods achieved this success "
"is its open-source nature and its community. As it grew, many developers, "
"moderators, modders and administrators have contributed their time, skills "
"and knowledge to the project. A special shout out goes to our fellow modders "
"who remained committed to creating content for the game and thus keeping it "
"alive for all these years."
