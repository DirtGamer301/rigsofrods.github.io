"...has improved! I tested with many more vehicles and I re-thought my "
"approach to parser design. For one thing, I began loosening the very strict "
"syntax checking which was causing vehicles to spawn crippled and littered "
"the \"spawner report\" window with loads of warning messages. Very common "
"mistakes, such as extra commas at the ends of lines, trailing comments (yes, "
"they weren't legit), invalid flags and bad lettercase of keywords is now "
"tolerated, often silently without warning message. Further, I began adding "
"\"fallback\" method of parsing for lines which don't make it through the "
"syntax check - in this case, parser will emit a warning and process the line "
"by means of RoR v0.38/v0.4.0.7 - unsafe, but mostly workable. So far, "
"\"nodes/nodes2\" were augumented this way."

"But most importantly, I changed my philosophical approach to processing the "
".truck format. From the very start, I knew that the parsing process used in "
"0.4.0.7 has to change, both to clear the way for further development of "
"RoR's physics (the old parser was seriously blocking it), and also because I "
"wanted to equip RoR with a built-in rig editor. However, at the same time, I "
"needed to maintain compatibility with existing content. Until now, I've been "
"trying to write a parser which would satisfy both requirements. It didn't "
"really work, most vehicles got broken and I wasted a lot of words rambling "
"about how bad was both the code and the truckfiles. But about a week ago, I "
"finally concluded the parser I wrote suits my needs, but it will never fit "
"together with existing content. After realizing this, it was obvious what I "
"have to do: "
"<<{baseurl}/docs/truck-description-file/index.adoc#Fileformatversion,Declare "
"a new fileformatversion>> for future content, and write an importer "
"component for content with lower fileformatversion. For the new "
"fileformatversion number, I chose \"450\", to resemble version number "
"0.4.5.0 and also to signify it works differently than older numbers (1,2,3) "
"- those were just informational and the parser ignored them. My "
"fileformatversion actually makes a big difference."

"Nonetheless, I began bumping into prevailing v0.38 -> v0.4.0.7 "
"incompatibilities, such as this one. Those will be harder to tackle because "
"the code of version 0.38 is 4 years old and uses outdated dependencies, so "
"it'll take some time to create a working dev version for testing and "
"investigation. I'll try my best, but no promises at this point."

"The editor is still not usable, but it's progressing steadily. This time, I "
"added support for wheels (meshwheels2 + flexbodywheels so far). There's a "
"selection menu in the top menubar and panels which can alter wheel "
"parameters. Changes to wheel size or number of rays are displayed "
"immediately and you can select + edit multiple wheels at the same "
"time. There's also an option to create a new rig from scratch and the "
"\"engine\" panel was equipped with [add engine]/[remove engine] buttons "
"which were missing before. The N/B editing controls are still not complete "
"(you can delete beams, but you can't add them yet), but work is being "
"done. Further, the wheel-subsystem components (selection menu, highlight "
"boxes, panels) were created as generic, so there will soon be similarly "
"implemented support for flares, props, wings and more features."

"Currently, RoR can handle roughly 500 nodes + 3000 beams per vehicle. With "
"so few elements, it's reasonable to do this work manually. However, this "
"system leaves a lot to be desired - the soft body physics model (with "
"weighted nodes acting like joints + weightless beams + stability "
"requirements) is very hard and unnatural for a human to work with. Also, the "
"RoR handles only enough N/B to create a grid-like chassis where 3d models "
"can be attached (props, flexbodies)."

"Now imagine I created a completely new physics engine which could handle "
"roughly *ten times more N/B* than the current engine (think *5 000 nodes* "
"and *30 000 beams*). These numbers must sound insane to RoR veterans, but I "
"have good technical reasons to believe such performance can be "
"achieved. Further details aside, you'll agree with me that creating so "
"detailed N/B by hand (or in Blender, or Editorizer, or any other similar "
"method) will become humanly impossible. Further, such performance increase "
"will deserve new approach to N/B architecture - instead of modelling a "
"vehicle as a whole, it will be possible to model individual components "
"(rigid frame, soft interior, heavy rigid engine, outer chassis components, "
"possibly a rollcage) and then join them to create more reallistic "
"deformation behavior."

"There is only one way to deal with such a modding challenge - using a "
"CAD-like editor where the vehicle can be modelled the way technical "
"engineers do - by defining real-world shapes of components, materials and "
"means of joining components together. The editor would then compute the best "
"fit N/B to simulate such vehicle. And THAT is precisely where I'm headed in "
"my rig-editor efforts. Currently, the editor has only partial support for "
"hand-editing the N/B, but that's just something to start with and an utility "
"for current modders + current content. But I'm really looking into the "
"future, and the future is CAD."
