Hi all RoR fans!

Another month has passed and it's time for me to write a progress report. In fact, the report is already slightly overdue because I've been really busy lately and I could only hardly follow RoR development. However, there are several other active developers and a growing number of testers and bug-reporters, so the project is steadily improving.

To shortly iterate what's been hapenning:
I've been working on rig editor, specifically adding panels to edit properties of nodes/beams and other beam types. Currently I'm adding support for all types of wheels, including the possibility to add/edit/delete wheels. I've also started several experimental dev branches oriented on performance and more maintainable code.
Hiradur continues to improve linux compatibility and maintains the multitude of RoR dependencies.
Aperion has returned to what he's good at - improving the very core of the gameplay, the physics simulation. So far, he's only been doing careful cleanups not to disrupt the upcoming stable release, but there seems to be a lot to look forward to.
Max98 is simultaneously improving many player-oriented aspects of the game, ranging from UI and HUD through enviromental improvements like skies and water to signifficant gameplay fixes.


== Status of planned 0.4.5 release

Current development effort aims towards a stable release with version number 0.4.5. This long-awaited release will fix many long-standing bugs, bring UI improvements and generally enhance player experience.

The major development problem regarding this project is vehicle support. In the past, version 0.4.0.x broke compatibility with older vehicles and forced modders to double-release their new content. Then I came and broke things further, despite I claimed to improve it. Up to now I wasn't able to completely restore all broken features, although situation is improving. Recently, RoR got a new window which displays all errors and warnings about about loaded vehicles. Thanks to Max98, the messages are also colored. This window will inform players what's wrong with their favorite vehicles and also help modders to avoid risky or unsupported practices.

I'd like to explain the cause of the current situation. When I analyzed RoR's vehicle loading code back in 2013, I discovered that the problem is in the design of the format - modders can define various parts of the vehicle (beams, nodes, wheels, cinecam, rotators, triggers, more wheels, more beams) in an arbitrary order, possibly interleaving things, and the parser will process all of it in the exact order. A software like this is a programmer's inferno because it's impossible to tell how exactly things are going depend on each other, how they will interact and what side effects may arise. Since RoR's vehicles were quite feature rich and features were built on top of one another, the amout of possible scenarios was astronomic. To name a few cases, I've seen vehicles defining some nodes, then defining wheels (which generate nodes) and then define more nodes. But hey, nodes have numbers, and if you auto-generate nodes in between, are you sure your numbering will continue correctly? Further, some modders attached beams to nodes before those were defined, or to nodes which were auto-generated by different sections (or possibly never generated). How is a programmer supposed to check if the connection is correct? To make things worse, there's the half-baked 'named nodes' feature (nodes2). More than half of truckfile sections don't support them, but at the same time, named nodes can still be reffered to with numbers, so modders did it that way. As a result, a programmer sees code trying to look for node 123 and he has no idea where that node will come from. Impossible to work with. Despite all these alarming facts, RoR vehicles have been working happily... until original authors left, along with the knowledge of all quirks and obscure mechanisms of the vehicle support. Un-involved coder didn't stand a chance. That's why 0.4.0x became incompatible with 0.38, and only problems followed.

My solution to this issue was developing new vehicle parser: one that would read all data first and only then process them, in a given order, to avoid all unexpected results. From software design standpoint, this is an only plausible solution. Unfortunately, this approach broke all vehicles which relied on the quirky nature of the old parser. In addition of that, many bugs were introducted in the process, because RoR's vehicle format is very feature-rich and I was a new coder to the project. So far, I've been able to track and fix many of those bugs and also detect and work-around many legacy requirements of older vehicles. I had been hoping to work around everything, however, I've arrived to a point where some vehicles directly conflict with my parser's architecture. And even thoug I'd really love to make everything work, I'm not willing to compromise future development by making compatibility hacks into my code. Some content will just have to go.

In a near future, I'll publish a new test build of NextStable, along with all latest fixes and compatibility enhancements, and I'll begin to sort out supported vs. unsupported content. I'll be in touch with modders, discussing the do's and dont's which 0.4.5 will impose.

Stay tuned.
