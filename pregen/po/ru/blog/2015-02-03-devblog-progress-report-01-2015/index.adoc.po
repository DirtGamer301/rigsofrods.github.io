"I joined the project in fall 2013. At the time, RoR was a dying project: the "
"original authors left to develop a commercial *BeamNG* project and community "
"had been inactive for more than 6 months or so. The last stable release was "
"_2 years old_ and the new version was half-baked. I evaluated the state of "
"the project, decided my priorities and started coding. For the first months, "
"my effort had no visible outcome as I decided to rewrite some very internal "
"logic, but finally I released several test builds and today, they're "
"consolidated into a single development version which aspires for a new "
"stable release."

"At the moment, the development is aimed towards delivering a new stable "
"release. This is very important to shake off the \"dead project\" feeling. "
"RoR has not had a stable release in years and with new similarily-themed "
"projects, BeamNG and SpinTires, it seemed that RoR will become history. That "
"is, however, not going to happen. Not only RoR lives on, but it also stays "
"unique among all competition. The planned release is dubbed NextStable and "
"has a version number 0.4.5, which displays the significant leap from last "
"available build 0.4.0.7. This leap is well deserved, RoR has undergone a "
"significant facelift and got rid of some long standing bugs which annoyed "
"and discouraged players for too long. Also, major refactoring was done on "
"the inside, to serve as groundwork for future enhancements and stability. "
"This is a list of the most important achievements:"

"RoR got main menu! Until now, RoR worked in a straightforward scenario "
"\"start - select track - select vehicle - play - exit game\", which wasn't "

"RoR got a built-in editor for vehicles. Until now, modding had to be done "
"with variety of external tools and a lot of hand-writing. However, this "
"approach will soon be history. The editor is not fully featured yet, but "
"it's architecture allows it to fully load/save the vehicle format and "
"perform any modifications, with mouse and hotkeys, in an interactive "
"environment. A primary inspiration for controls and workflow is Blender."

"Rig definition file format (.truck) was completely re-coded. The old logic "
"was flawed, bloated and effectively blocked any future enhancements. The new "
"one is a separate component designed for stability and extensibility. It "
"also allowed creating the rig editor. However, a lot of content stopped "
"working in the process, sometimes due to bugs in new code, but often because "
"of syntax flaws or inconsistencies and bad practices in .truck files "
"themselves. Work is being done to fix the situation."
