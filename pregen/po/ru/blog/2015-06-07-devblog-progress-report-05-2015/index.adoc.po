"testing our latest builds, and the dev team does their best to attend to and "

"It's still in development, there's still no release date and the purpose has "
"slowly and silently changed. Original plan was to only make RoR stable, "
"content-compatible and crash-free while ignoring performance and not adding "
"any features. However, volunteer-based development progresses slowly and "
"players are equally concerned about performance, stability, graphics, "
"performance and gameplay experience as a whole. And yes, I know I wrote "
"\"performance\" twice. So, the new motto of 0.4.5 is \"All kinds of "
"improvements, as long as nothing gets broken and it runs at least a little "
"faster than before\"."

"Another improvement is speed of vehicle loading. During testing, I got angry "
"about vehicles taking too long to load, so I incorporated a tiny link:"
"https://floodyberry.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/high-performance-cplusplus-"
"profiling[profiler] into the codebase and started investigating. The major "
"bottleneck were verbose logs I added to the spawn process. I added config "
"options for them and made them disabled by default. Next, it got interesting "
"- the bottleneck were FlexBodies, but curiously, not their generation, but "
"finding LOD files in OGRE's resource system (which is super slow and "
"targeted for elimination by OGRE team, btw). Since link:http://www."
"rigsofrods.com/threads/119482-Flexbodies-LODs-really[nobody seems to use the "
"feature], I added config option to disable it by default. Next bottleneck "
"was flexbody generation itself and I found a way to bypass even that - I "
"added a cache support to flexbodies, so they are only generated once and "
"saved as binary file to cache, subseqent spawns load it from the cache. "
"Right now the feature is disabled by default, see file /resources/skeleton/"
"conf/README.txt for instructions how to enable and test it. I have to say "
"I'm quite proud of this improvement and I'm planning to use it in more areas "
"of RoR to speed up loading even further."

"I've done enough dreaming in the last devblog post. Now I'm back to the "
"boring but necessary fixing of vehicle/map compatibility. Current work: "
"fixed objects on maps. But I can't resist the urge to slowly enhance the rig "
"editor as well. Current work: flares. And finally, I also began attending to "
"performance issues. Current work: adding a performance graph window to help "
"pinpoint the bottleneck on various player hardware. This makes the "
"development somewhat fuzzy and unfocused, but it's the best answer to the "
"requests from the community."
