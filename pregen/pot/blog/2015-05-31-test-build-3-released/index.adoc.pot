"fixed 0.4.0.7's malformed flexbodies bug. Flexbodies were spawned deformed, "
"see screenshots in "
"link:https://github.com/RigsOfRods/rigs-of-rods/issues/16[this ticket]. I "
"fixed it by simply backporting flexbody code from 0.38.67 (last stable "
"release). However, I'm a little worried about performance impact, the code "
"uses precise but expensive calculations."

"Added built-in profiler. I incorporated "
"link:https://floodyberry.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/high-performance-cplusplus-profiling/[this "
"library] into RoR. It works by putting tracking macros in the code (so "
"called instrumentation) and generates a very nice HTML output. I've added "
"instrumentation for RigSpawner class (per-function) and FlexBody generation "
"(constructor, detailed). Profiling configuration is found in header "
"RigLoadingProfilerControl.h. Feel free to add your own instrumentation and "
"control headers."

"Added ror.cfg option to disable flexbody LODs By profiling, I discovered "
"that the slowest part of vehicle loading are flexbodies, but not their "
"generation, but seeking flexbody-LOD files in OGRE's resource system (mega "
"slow, scheduled for elimination by OGRE team). I added a ror.cfg option to "
"disable this."

"Added flexbody cache support After disabling the flexbody LODs, the slowest "
"part of rig loading was flexbody generation. To speed things up, I "
"implemented a caching support for flexbodies - first time the vehicle is "
"loaded, a file \"flexbodies_mod_MODNUMBER.dat\" is generated in cache, and "
"subsequent spawns of the same vehicle load it."
