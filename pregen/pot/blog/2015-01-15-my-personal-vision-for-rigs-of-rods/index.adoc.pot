"With the blog section now being back alive I though I'd give it a shot and "
"write about my personal goals for Rigs of Rods. Every developer working on "
"an open source project usually has his own vision for what the project could "
"become and works on things that bring it closer to that vision."

"I would like to see RoR going much faster than it currently does. RoR is "
"usually limited by the CPU as it has to do a lot of floating point math to "
"simulate the behaviour of beams and nodes. Other limiting factors probably "
"are memory latency and bandwidth since structures for beams and nodes are "
"quite large in size and there are hundreds of them per vehicle. Besides the "
"fact that the whole phsyics core could use a cleanup it is also required "
"that we increase accuracy (discussion: "
"link:http://www.rigsofrods.com/threads/118051-Discussion-Moving-to-double-precision-for-physics[Discussion-Moving-to-double-precision-for-physics]) "
"to improve the quality of the simulation. When we do that a major overhaul "
"of the physics core is needed which would be a great chance to improve "
"performance as well. I believe that there is more room for parallelization "
"and that we should use it whenever possible. In the best case RoR should be "
"able to max out any number of CPU cores while still running significantly "
"faster on a single core than it does now."

"Besides a speedup in performance I would also like to see the physics "
"calculations being moved to the server. The details are unclear yet because "
"it would suddenly increase server hardware requirements a lot. Maybe we will "
"have an option to toggle serverside physics on and off.  The major benefit "
"of serverside physics calculation is that multiplayer collisions are "
"possible, something that many have asked for and I want to see happening "
"myself. It would also lead to a clear separation between client and server, "
"potentially putting less stress on the client than before. We will have to "
"see how much that could be since some calculations will probably still be "
"needed clientside for movement predicition to reduce perceived lag. It would "
"certainly seperate rendering and physics though, already increasing "
"performance."

"I got access to an 80-core cluster computer. My ultimate goal is that the "
"RoR server (with physics calculations being serverside) is able to take "
"advantage of such a system. I would like to see it being able to make use of "
"all cluster nodes using OpenMPI to spread physics calculations across all "
"cores so we can potentially have many people spawning many vehicles in one "
"multiplayer session. In case this becomes possible I may host a community "
"event, hosting a RoR server on said cluster for an evening to have a big "
"wreck fest. It's still uncertain if this is possible at all. The possible "
"degree of parallelization for the physics core has yet to be "
"determined. When working with clusters additional problems arise like "
"latency and bandwidth for communication between nodes. The latency could be "
"large enough to make this whole project fail but since a similar project "
"probably has never been done before we can't know for certain until we "
"tried."
